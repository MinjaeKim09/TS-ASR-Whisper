[   0.36-   1.72] MEE071: funkish
[   0.96-   6.84] MEE073: wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings
[   3.60-   5.36] FEO072: yeah exactly
[   3.76-  12.12] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah welcome to start ok
[   8.60-   8.94] FEO070: ok
[  12.30-  15.22] FEO070: so what do we need to talk about
[  13.20-  13.64] FEO072: shall we
[  14.96-  15.48] MEE071: is it anybody
[  15.20-  20.20] FEO072: shall we just go around and everyone says what they what they have been doing for the past couple of
[  19.08-  23.68] MEE071: is it without anything
[  20.48-  25.24] FEO072: well i am sorry
[  21.48-  23.32] MEE073: no no
[  25.48-  29.78] MEE073: ok sounds like you have done some
[  25.76-  26.16] FEO070: yeah
[  28.44-  29.90] MEE071: sorry
[  30.00-  34.40] FEO072: kay well i have got a browser now which whoops i already got
[  35.52-  45.50] FEO070: good start oh i dropped mine as well this is not a good start
[  41.78-  43.44] MEE071: yeah
[  43.96-  44.12] FEO072: ok
[  48.28-  50.04] FEO070: ok so yeah
[  48.72-  49.02] FEO072: ok
[  50.38-  60.00] FEO072: so yeah we have got a browser with which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics and then when you go
[  60.00-  66.80] FEO072: on the menu you can select a summarization box which pops up and an audio player
[  68.24-  68.56] MEE071: right
[  68.80-  84.76] FEO072: and i s i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search and it loads up just the background windows are empty and so when you start you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that
[  86.48-  87.08] FEO072: that make sense
[  90.00- 103.92] FEO072: the transcription box has got a summarized bot button which does not do anything yet now i wonder how we want to do you know we want a pop up window with the speaker characterization
[ 106.20- 119.98] FEO072: either we could do that you know when does a pop up come either we can when you click on the the i d any sort of i d in the transcription box or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarized
[ 120.00- 134.80] FEO072: button so that you actually even the transcription box but so that you click on a button and then it opens and whatever that speaker characterization is the problem is the the left click is already used because it highlights that
[ 136.60- 149.96] FEO072: that part of speech or whatever that what he is going to say yeah the left click highlights it so that you can i do not know what happens when you double click actually but that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one
[ 138.78- 140.56] MEE071: the the left or right
[ 142.16- 142.52] MEE071: right
[ 142.60- 144.00] FEO070: kay you can
[ 150.00- 160.74] FEO072: and double click or something else i think so yeah when you left click it you can for example set set the marker there so that the the audio goes from there i think
[ 162.68- 168.76] FEO072: so we can not put it on left click we could put it on a right click we could for example have a little menu that pops up
[ 169.46- 170.92] MEE071: yeah that would be quite good that is what i said
[ 170.64- 176.68] FEO072: so right click on a menu you know and you can click on speaker characterization that pops on the
[ 176.92- 179.68] MEE071: what else can we have in the in
[ 180.36- 183.64] FEO072: that is a good point i do not know anything else
[ 182.44- 186.96] MEE071: yeah otherwise we just have a right click on it
[ 183.16- 185.98] MEE073: i know why it is everything but
[ 185.12- 197.88] FEO072: yeah yeah but i do not know about you but usually in windows you right click does not do anything does not it opens a menu yeah so yeah so but that would be yeah that would be good just yeah
[ 186.04- 186.42] FEO070: yeah
[ 190.08- 190.60] MEE071: is it
[ 192.30- 198.04] MEE071: and maybe yeah yeah that is what maybe we are going to yeah it is a bit a bit weird to just start bringing up stuff with me
[ 194.84- 202.60] MEE073: no to just have sort of same sort of idiom throughout kind of
[ 202.12- 202.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 203.24- 203.56] MEE071: yeah
[ 204.64- 206.60] FEO072: or just you know or just a button
[ 207.60- 207.80] MEE073: yeah
[ 207.72- 210.00] FEO070: i guess a button button makes a bit
[ 210.00- 220.56] FEO070: more sense cause otherwise you do not really know that oh what if i right click that what happens then is i can maybe yeah
[ 218.28- 221.56] FEO072: well no more you still have the menu yeah the menu pop up there
[ 219.00- 221.32] MEE071: you still have the menu yeah the menu pop up
[ 223.04- 231.24] FEO072: well oh yeah it is more obvious is not it what you can do yeah yeah that is true yeah it is more intuitive
[ 224.94- 225.52] FEO070: smash away
[ 225.08- 232.04] MEE071: i think like what you can do yeah yeah that is true yeah it is more interesting because but well
[ 228.18- 228.90] FEO070: yeah
[ 228.64- 240.00] MEE073: yeah well then it is not as expensive like if you want to add more things in the future anyway i do not mean about this i do not know where is the menu i think it is more flexible anyway but i would not give it a two
[ 231.20- 233.10] FEO070: but well yeah
[ 234.62- 235.40] MEE071: yeah but where is it
[ 235.52- 236.76] FEO072: maybe maybe
[ 238.90- 240.00] MEE071: yeah well in it
[ 240.00- 251.96] MEE071: i guess in in in meeting browser one point one you can have a menu instead of a button but this one yeah
[ 240.00- 240.42] MEE073: yeah
[ 243.00- 249.02] MEE073: well you can have a menu instead of a button but
[ 248.76- 260.06] FEO072: interface but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in
[ 261.36- 266.64] FEO072: like a search for that user is that going to be useful or too much or
[ 263.40- 263.80] MEE071: yeah
[ 270.00- 272.90] MEE071: it comes down it says give me all your meetings
[ 272.72- 279.08] FEO072: yeah so when you right click on it one m one option will be emailing meetings characterize the speaker
[ 280.10- 280.52] MEE071: yep
[ 284.08- 285.28] FEO072: or is that too much i mean
[ 285.12- 290.28] FEO070: i dunno i mean it is more like part of the
[ 286.06- 288.84] MEE071: i guess so it is a funny thing to write
[ 291.76- 298.92] FEO070: browsing sort of thing more than the speaker characterization as steve mentioned and i do not really know how to
[ 296.86- 299.48] FEO072: yeah yeah that is true yeah
[ 298.68- 299.80] MEE073: yeah
[ 298.96- 299.76] FEO070: yeah
[ 300.00- 302.40] FEO070: all the speaking characters it is true
[ 301.00- 303.66] FEO072: yeah that is true it would be nice to have it in connect inter connected
[ 301.44- 302.32] MEE073: ok cool
[ 303.36- 319.48] MEE073: yeah like maybe tie that in with dialog acts or something as well i mean speaker characterization tied into i dunno t just some way to sort of leverage that information like we have it we are doing it but what how does it help the browsing or what can it give us in the browsing yeah
[ 316.60- 319.76] FEO072: what you mean the the speaker characterization oh well yeah i mean
[ 321.38- 330.00] FEO072: i do not know about that i mean it is the speaker characterization is a bit like you said i mean it is like a nice thing we do not we are not actually sure what the user wants of it but
[ 330.00- 332.36] FEO072: it is interesting so why not give it to him
[ 332.74- 333.20] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 333.30- 333.54] MEE073: right
[ 334.08- 335.52] FEO072: i i think we should do it i mean
[ 335.32- 356.30] FEO070: yeah i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like well if you get speed characterization that someone talks a lot in a certain topic and then if you i do not know click on that topic you will get everything that is in that topic or whatever i mean that is that is still another
[ 354.76- 359.80] FEO072: yeah i mean that is that is still another level further i mean we are not even there yet you know exactly does it not probably
[ 358.84- 359.82] FEO070: no so
[ 359.54- 359.86] MEE071: yeah
[ 360.00- 364.20] FEO072: or the speaker characterization yeah you you have to first define what what happens when you click on the user
[ 364.44- 370.32] MEE071: with the speaker characterization first before we cross over there
[ 366.96- 371.92] FEO072: yeah yes so should we try try to do a right click menu then
[ 367.40- 369.16] MEE073: yeah
[ 374.72- 376.28] MEE071: yeah alright well
[ 376.28- 387.86] MEE073: is that just from the main you know is that from any particular window like if we want to sort of get like if we are on the users versus like a topic or something have a light click from for these various things to yeah
[ 377.92- 378.14] FEO072: sorry
[ 378.12- 379.40] MEE071: even if it is one thing
[ 385.70- 390.00] FEO072: yeah yes wait yeah there is a second thing about the topics
[ 390.00- 404.88] FEO072: the topic window you want to somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that yeah so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well and have a different menu and
[ 397.68- 399.22] MEE073: right yep yep
[ 400.00- 404.88] MEE071: ok so ok so this lot is for
[ 402.28- 403.04] MEE073: ok yeah
[ 404.26- 406.72] MEE073: it is consistent throughout so yeah
[ 406.14- 406.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 406.92- 408.08] MEE071: on the speaker
[ 409.64- 420.00] FEO072: so yeah so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual
[ 410.34- 411.80] MEE071: yeah this lot is
[ 420.00- 424.12] FEO072: observations and when then we have the interlinking by right click basically
[ 424.56- 424.80] MEE073: right
[ 426.12- 449.98] MEE073: actually yeah like another common thing like we have it sort of set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu i mean that is kind of a typical kind of action that would happen if you double click on a particular topic or something that it goes to sort of like a default view so it will be like all the cases of that topic either whatever we decide the default to be whether it is in all meetings or just in one meeting and just show up the in particular
[ 435.40- 435.96] FEO072: double click
[ 440.70- 441.12] FEO072: oh
[ 450.00- 462.72] MEE073: are instances of that topic in the meeting like and just thinking to have the default there so if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that is the most common thing that is going to happen so the double click will not do that and it is just save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
[ 459.08- 459.92] FEO072: yeah
[ 462.78- 466.96] FEO072: i do not see there is anything obvious that was that would be able that would be
[ 462.88- 463.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 466.04- 469.32] MEE073: well it might come to us and start playing with it
[ 469.40- 469.72] FEO070: yeah
[ 469.52- 471.60] MEE071: what was that i think i understand do you mean
[ 471.44- 480.00] MEE073: like we have the the right click menu you know the menu right clicking but instead of like have a default double click so there is a so it will be a choice from a menu
[ 471.84- 472.56] FEO070: yeah
[ 473.68- 474.12] MEE071: yeah
[ 478.20- 480.00] MEE071: oh sorry i need to figure that out
[ 478.64- 478.96] FEO070: yep
[ 480.00- 484.08] MEE071: what is the most common use of the double p ok
[ 480.00- 482.76] MEE073: yeah exactly
[ 481.60- 481.84] FEO070: yeah
[ 483.70- 487.84] FEO070: like show the speaker characteristics and voice buttons or things things
[ 486.08- 486.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 486.36- 493.86] FEO072: yeah but then then there is a problem with a lot of windows popping up again and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know
[ 486.56- 486.92] MEE071: yeah
[ 494.72- 497.20] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 496.26- 502.04] FEO070: but if you do double click on something do not you expect something to happen then
[ 502.78- 504.52] FEO072: yeah maybe you should
[ 503.48- 505.18] FEO070: well
[ 504.56- 510.00] MEE071: sometimes i do not like to sit where you are oh go away it is still coming up yeah
[ 506.88- 510.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 509.50- 509.98] FEO070: yeah
[ 510.00- 518.64] MEE071: it is not it is not in the world but yeah
[ 510.00- 512.44] MEE073: it is not it is not the end of the world
[ 511.76- 530.56] FEO072: especially if you have a touch pad it goes oh well i will i will check what it does on on double click at the moment cause i think it might do something but it is cause yeah but i do not i do not i really do not see anything obvious that that
[ 515.60- 517.80] MEE073: yeah right
[ 521.62- 526.52] FEO070: yeah cause i am thinking we might have to do something but it is good to learn
[ 521.80- 522.08] MEE073: ok
[ 526.92- 527.20] MEE071: yeah
[ 532.32- 533.62] FEO072: i mean if you can think of something like
[ 537.16- 537.60] FEO070: oh
[ 538.68- 539.12] FEO072: sorry
[ 542.32- 544.52] FEO070: i am guessing it depends on the
[ 546.28- 548.84] FEO070: yeah what you are clicking on so
[ 548.62- 556.56] FEO072: sorry yeah another thing single audio files do we want to use them or not
[ 558.62- 561.56] MEE071: we do not know yet do we yeah david do you mean single channel
[ 561.76- 565.24] FEO072: yeah single channel those single channel files do we want them i mean
[ 561.92- 562.52] FEO070: a single channel
[ 565.80- 570.00] MEE071: probably not but we might need them for the fluencies if we try to look at
[ 569.08- 570.00] MEE073: what kind of idea
[ 569.36- 569.96] FEO072: yeah ok
[ 570.00- 578.32] FEO072: yeah yeah i mean we might use them in while work to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse you can
[ 570.00- 575.00] MEE071: audio but at the moment no but
[ 570.00- 571.20] MEE073: yeah yeah i mean we
[ 577.92- 581.00] MEE071: he might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person is saying
[ 581.40- 585.66] FEO072: do you though i mean it is not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own do you
[ 581.92- 582.60] FEO070: no
[ 585.06- 589.80] MEE071: unless you can not hear it properly or something somebody is talking over somebody else or something well
[ 590.96- 593.98] MEE071: we will just say no for now and put it in maybe it is all in the video
[ 592.92- 594.64] FEO072: yeah
[ 595.96- 596.28] FEO072: yeah
[ 596.80- 600.00] MEE071: yeah cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data
[ 600.00- 603.32] MEE071: you probably not want to deflate them all did you
[ 601.54- 601.88] FEO072: yeah
[ 610.04- 616.22] FEO072: yeah wha what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you have mentioned do you think do you think it would be alright
[ 615.40- 620.64] MEE073: i think we probably need that though to have the the full flexibility we need to have there but
[ 619.08- 626.12] FEO072: that is what i feel as well i mean i am i am very much i i want to have everything customizable
[ 626.36- 630.00] MEE073: well the thing is typically though is someone is going to have five windows open at the same time probably
[ 630.00- 636.48] MEE073: not probably just two two or three of whatever whatever they are working on like dialog acts or whatever like that
[ 631.00- 647.82] FEO072: probably not no yeah two or three maybe but yeah but yeah it depends i mean i i really want to put the summary in somewhere you know and the summary for example is typical you open the window you read through it you might click on you know close it again straight away but it would be good to have it there
[ 639.86- 640.04] MEE073: yeah
[ 646.20- 649.68] MEE071: yeah i think it is i think it is fine i think it is fine
[ 646.56- 647.28] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 646.98- 656.36] FEO070: but but but well currently i mean you probably i do not know if you want to have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time
[ 657.56- 660.00] FEO070: so maybe you can just like choose
[ 660.00- 663.44] FEO070: use the s same window for transcription and summary
[ 663.64- 666.58] MEE073: it is like half a time there there is no one about to change the things
[ 665.00- 667.04] FEO072: absolutely yeah
[ 665.32- 690.00] FEO070: yeah touch are nice touch are nice
[ 669.14- 671.32] MEE071: yeah definitely zellis style
[ 669.48- 669.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 670.16- 675.08] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah yeah oh that is right i am not sure yeah
[ 675.16- 681.60] MEE071: does anybody know how to do that ok yeah java i do not think java knows how to do that really maybe it probably can but fair
[ 676.28- 682.60] FEO072: yeah i am sure i am sure you can do anything
[ 677.98- 683.20] MEE073: yeah
[ 682.94- 690.00] MEE071: if you really knew what you are doing but i do not know it is a bit of a cripple javas would know you talk at the a sometimes it is a bit
[ 689.76- 690.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 690.00- 690.56] MEE071: ok
[ 691.92- 692.80] FEO072: i can have a look
[ 694.14- 694.44] MEE071: yeah
[ 694.84- 703.28] FEO070: yeah or just i do not know but yeah that might be changed to contents of the same window like from transcription to summary
[ 696.94- 698.76] FEO072: but yeah that that might be an idea yeah
[ 701.76- 702.44] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 704.36- 704.66] MEE071: yeah
[ 704.52- 704.96] FEO070: oh right
[ 707.76- 712.52] MEE073: yeah we are even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the toolbar for that window
[ 714.44- 714.96] MEE073: or something
[ 715.98- 717.20] FEO070: yeah yeah definitely probably
[ 716.04- 719.98] MEE073: well different ways we can do it it does not does not have to be a tab or whatever just yeah
[ 719.04- 720.00] FEO070: no no it could be
[ 720.00- 725.54] FEO070: like transcription summary like you just press a little button and
[ 720.00- 720.76] MEE073: yeah
[ 721.88- 722.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 723.92- 724.20] MEE071: yeah
[ 725.08- 729.56] MEE073: or check marks even have two of them check marks yeah
[ 726.16- 738.32] MEE071: yeah that will reduce the number of windows really would not it which is quite good cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows if you have your use photoshop has got loads and you are always good forever going oh get out of the way there is always stuff in the way is not there
[ 727.18- 727.46] FEO070: see
[ 736.18- 738.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 739.04- 740.82] FEO070: yeah i will watch it
[ 740.42- 748.70] FEO072: but i mean people get used to it i mean when you use a windows or a minix for all that you have a lot of windows open to manage them
[ 741.40- 741.56] MEE071: yeah
[ 747.76- 749.68] MEE071: you do yeah
[ 749.44- 749.68] MEE073: yeah
[ 751.80- 752.06] MEE073: true
[ 752.04- 762.86] MEE071: yeah unless can you i do not suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that can can you do that ok well that is alright yeah yeah well of course you can actually
[ 753.84- 754.84] FEO070: it is the
[ 756.36- 758.24] FEO072: yeah you can minimize them yeah yeah
[ 757.88- 758.68] MEE073: yeah ok
[ 761.36- 779.48] MEE073: yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can you know transcript without the disfluency transcript with a difflu disfluency of all these you know of all these sort of using the same window and so we can do a lot of and probably mutually with the disfluency
[ 762.32- 762.64] FEO070: yeah
[ 769.72- 771.72] FEO072: yeah that is true they are they are definitely
[ 773.12- 775.26] FEO072: yeah they are definitely going to be in the same one yeah
[ 777.78- 778.20] FEO070: cool
[ 778.24- 778.76] FEO072: exactly
[ 779.28- 780.00] FEO072: yeah that
[ 780.00- 782.72] FEO072: that was the plan for the disadvantages anyway so
[ 781.92- 782.14] MEE073: yeah
[ 784.04- 789.14] FEO072: yeah do you want to do that with summaries then put the summaries in in the same way now
[ 790.24- 791.40] FEO072: mutually exclusively
[ 790.78- 803.88] FEO070: yeah well could i i do not know but transcripts it sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then like full meeting meeting without disabilities and summarize
[ 800.36- 800.68] MEE073: right
[ 803.20- 806.62] FEO072: summaries yeah do you want to do that yeah
[ 804.48- 805.88] MEE073: yeah that does not make sense
[ 805.92- 806.12] FEO070: yeah
[ 806.86- 807.92] MEE071: yeah sounds good
[ 810.40- 811.44] FEO070: yeah
[ 816.56- 822.40] FEO072: and finally the prototype he is a paperback what kind of prototype could we produce
[ 823.08- 823.96] MEE073: but not in february
[ 824.28- 836.48] FEO072: cause i am i am just you know we are going to the lab and i am saying alright what am i going to change today you know and it kind of just it just develops i am not aiming for anything do we want to aim for something
[ 841.52- 846.76] FEO072: i am i am pretty much getting there anyway to be honest it is not it is not going to be a lot more work
[ 846.64- 856.32] FEO070: i guess it is i mean just to try and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so we s yeah yeah
[ 854.60- 856.08] MEE073: yeah that is what we need yeah
[ 854.70- 860.16] MEE071: yeah that is what we need yeah something just slightly more than just that i am sorry yeah
[ 856.46- 856.82] FEO072: alright
[ 858.44- 858.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 858.56- 859.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 858.82- 864.72] FEO070: yeah yeah just so see the integration works sort of which we can think of
[ 865.12- 865.76] FEO072: true
[ 865.36- 866.44] MEE071: yeah definitely
[ 866.84- 867.44] FEO070: i do not know
[ 868.88- 869.98] FEO070: so i guess that is what
[ 870.00- 871.00] FEO070: we do not have this one
[ 870.94- 876.16] MEE071: i think that is kind of what he meant as well is not it really seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be
[ 872.80- 873.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 876.32- 877.48] FEO072: well that is kind of cool
[ 878.02- 879.22] MEE071: and prototype of the gooey
[ 879.32- 888.64] FEO070: yeah well i f i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down so i do not know what you mean
[ 886.42- 889.76] MEE071: yeah
[ 890.84- 891.20] FEO070: i do not know
[ 892.00- 900.00] MEE073: actually is the code accessible like the the gooey stuff that you have done there like can we just like calculate the latest stuff out of your directory or something
[ 900.00- 906.00] MEE073: yeah like if we are going to just try and like take a look or something try and just plug in some i think you can which
[ 900.40- 905.24] FEO072: yeah i do not know can we access other peoples
[ 905.04- 907.84] MEE071: you can make it do you make it world readable then anybody can
[ 907.32- 912.64] MEE073: but if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we know the directory to get in and just
[ 910.52- 910.84] MEE071: yeah
[ 912.44- 917.34] FEO072: yeah sure i do not know if it is readable at the moment but you can sure have it i do not know
[ 913.62- 915.08] MEE073: and maybe make the pages
[ 916.52- 920.14] MEE073: i think by default they are no or
[ 916.82- 925.44] MEE071: no they are not they are not they are not they are only default then only you can read them like you can see them but you can not read them
[ 918.32- 918.62] FEO070: no
[ 920.14- 920.52] FEO070: no
[ 922.52- 924.20] MEE073: ok ok
[ 923.64- 924.20] FEO072: alright
[ 925.60- 930.00] FEO072: right well i will make that readable then so
[ 925.64- 926.52] MEE073: ok alright
[ 927.86- 928.12] MEE073: ok
[ 928.00- 928.34] MEE071: yeah
[ 930.00- 932.42] FEO072: the directory is my number
[ 932.60- 936.28] MEE073: right you just email to us ok yeah yeah yeah right ok
[ 934.70- 946.76] FEO072: well this is not difficult it is in all the emails actually no o four o four five five five
[ 936.44- 937.62] MEE071: what is your number
[ 937.36- 937.80] MEE073: ok
[ 939.18- 943.74] MEE073: yeah
[ 940.00- 941.36] MEE071: your number
[ 943.96- 944.34] MEE071: ok
[ 948.52- 949.06] FEO072: six o
[ 949.80- 950.80] FEO070: say that again oh four
[ 950.76- 952.54] FEO072: o four five five five six o
[ 952.96- 953.82] MEE071: and then it is
[ 954.94- 958.32] FEO072: and then there is a folder n l s s d
[ 958.82- 959.40] MEE071: and fifty
[ 959.56- 960.00] FEO072: and it is called
[ 960.00- 961.82] FEO072: the end browser
[ 962.52- 964.76] MEE071: the m browser for meetings
[ 963.72- 966.32] FEO072: yes the end from the thing
[ 964.04- 966.06] MEE073: for meetings
[ 966.08- 982.34] MEE071: i hope you hope you never have to look in my direction it is just pure chaos mine is serious chaos as far as everyone
[ 967.56- 967.72] MEE073: two
[ 970.02- 975.86] FEO072: no i am i am extremely organized i have got all the certain thing i love following
[ 975.60- 976.12] FEO070: yeah
[ 986.52- 989.28] FEO072: yep so that is me doing someone else more talk about their stuff
[ 991.94- 994.72] MEE071: total java ones
[ 994.48- 996.96] FEO070: i can tell you what i am in s p t
[ 996.88- 998.78] MEE071: ok
[ 997.52- 999.14] MEE073: great idea
[ 999.96-1011.60] FEO070: oh i do not know i basically i started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there is anything out there to use sort of just
[1011.40-1012.92] FEO072: w what were you doing again
[1012.92-1019.62] MEE073: yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so yeah so just ok
[1013.08-1020.00] FEO070: yeah so yeah oh yeah so yeah yeah yeah it is just ok found it
[1015.20-1016.04] FEO072: s
[1015.80-1017.32] MEE071: yeah
[1018.98-1019.32] FEO072: ok
[1020.00-1024.76] FEO070: tutorial but inverted search indexing but i have not read it yet i think it is
[1022.56-1031.48] MEE073: so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked him earlier cause yeah like reusing code and stuff and just like ok
[1024.26-1024.76] FEO072: is that cool
[1027.16-1029.00] FEO070: yeah oh yeah
[1028.16-1028.76] FEO072: oh
[1030.10-1032.40] FEO072: oh right and that is pretty much there is it
[1030.96-1031.12] FEO070: oh
[1031.00-1033.44] MEE071: you have found some time for film in the
[1032.80-1041.48] FEO070: yeah well i do not know if it is usable i i have not looked at it but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing oh right yeah
[1032.84-1037.86] MEE073: yeah
[1035.84-1036.22] MEE071: ok
[1037.96-1038.84] FEO072: performa to
[1039.78-1045.04] MEE071: oh right come on cool so even if it does not work you can jiggly plug it around and make it around properly
[1040.72-1041.40] FEO072: oh right cool
[1041.04-1041.28] MEE073: yeah
[1044.22-1049.92] MEE073: yeah probably we will probably still have to do some other file manager while i am like creating sh i am messing around some
[1044.58-1045.28] FEO070: yeah yep
[1048.32-1050.00] MEE071: yeah
[1050.00-1052.20] MEE071: but yeah the basics is that oh ok that is ok
[1050.00-1050.20] MEE073: so
[1052.00-1052.44] FEO070: yeah
[1052.08-1052.36] MEE073: yeah
[1053.14-1053.92] FEO072: yeah that is handy
[1054.68-1056.80] FEO070: yeah
[1056.48-1058.00] FEO072: so you think it should not be too difficult
[1060.16-1077.70] FEO070: i do not know i am i was a bit worried about one well when we when we talk about this with file with normal files i mean how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from the x m l files and stuff to be able to do the mixing
[1077.96-1080.00] FEO072: oh i see yeah no
[1079.60-1080.00] MEE071: yeah
[1080.00-1082.54] FEO072: have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
[1082.64-1082.84] MEE073: yeah
[1083.44-1103.60] MEE071: i have been trying to write something to read the x m l when i can get rid of it and i can get rid of it but i am having trouble putting it anywhere else so it will come up on the screen but at the moment i have not managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it but i guess it is not really good but yeah
[1092.52-1095.92] MEE073: come up on the screen
[1095.60-1096.12] FEO070: ok
[1099.60-1104.98] FEO070: ok what are you writing in jala or yeah ok
[1101.18-1101.50] MEE073: make it
[1103.92-1104.12] MEE073: right
[1106.40-1108.40] FEO070: you know a bunch of files
[1106.72-1110.00] FEO072: i mean you should look have have a look at the the browser code then because
[1110.00-1116.40] FEO072: you know they will really extract for example transcripts or at least
[1114.40-1117.48] MEE071: yeah yeah i am sure i do yeah
[1118.40-1119.00] MEE073: that is great
[1119.40-1130.48] MEE071: yeah oh yeah i am sure something is going on i am sure i am making a main of it
[1133.94-1139.98] FEO070: yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like
[1140.00-1148.40] FEO070: collaborating with fowl things i mean if you already started on on stuff i guess we can
[1142.24-1142.56] MEE073: yeah
[1145.72-1147.52] MEE071: yeah absolutely
[1148.90-1150.24] MEE071: should share as much as possible
[1150.22-1150.72] FEO070: yeah
[1150.76-1152.04] MEE073: libraries
[1152.74-1153.14] MEE071: yeah
[1153.38-1156.36] FEO070: yeah should we i do not know
[1158.28-1169.72] FEO070: meet up and see what we could do i mean i do not know see what you have done and see what we need when we know more about what we need maybe
[1164.64-1165.04] MEE071: yeah
[1164.72-1169.98] MEE073: yeah next week sounds like it is not like
[1167.28-1169.98] MEE071: next week shall we do it
[1170.00-1186.70] MEE071: they actually have not done anything this week cause this week has been manic but well whatever it was last week then the the the week as it as it is rather than the proper week did not we try it has been a little bit manic the last the last week
[1170.00-1171.96] MEE073: so you are still working
[1173.64-1175.96] MEE073: yes exactly same thing yeah i mean but
[1173.92-1175.60] FEO070: yeah yeah
[1175.28-1177.72] FEO072: i mean this week is only two days old
[1176.64-1180.48] MEE073: oh i see oh lastly
[1178.64-1180.40] FEO070: oh lastly
[1178.92-1180.16] FEO072: oh lastly
[1184.16-1184.32] MEE073: yeah
[1185.78-1189.88] MEE073: well well you are in s p and l p and s p two right yeah that is right
[1188.20-1196.04] MEE071: yeah that is right yeah and then we had to do an i r p whatever it was last week as well which is only a page one but it is quite difficult to draw a page
[1188.60-1188.84] FEO070: yep
[1196.48-1197.72] MEE073: yeah oh
[1196.90-1199.98] FEO072: yeah that is complete rubbish yeah
[1197.96-1199.98] MEE071: well it was it was not
[1200.00-1201.84] FEO072: she is so stupid
[1200.00-1210.28] MEE071: but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit and i said it is better than it is not yeah but it is better for you
[1205.86-1207.00] MEE073: yeah that is fun
[1211.16-1226.04] MEE073: kay so yeah i was thinking that we can probably d start attacking this seriously i am just you know hopefully have something by next week that we can sort of try integrating into the group ok i think that should be possible
[1214.16-1215.36] FEO070: yeah i think so
[1216.04-1216.26] MEE071: yeah
[1223.92-1224.16] FEO070: yeah
[1225.08-1228.92] FEO072: well it is the browsers i use it now or as no it was there
[1225.20-1225.98] FEO070: well it is ok
[1230.00-1243.72] FEO072: when i took it uses the the n x t search to get the data out of the out of the files which i think is odd but i am not quite sure how it works yet i do not quite understand it
[1236.96-1238.08] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1244.84-1246.34] MEE071: so win it win it
[1247.36-1255.72] FEO072: to get the data for example to get the summarization data you have to search for i think the i d s on something yeah
[1256.46-1259.52] MEE071: that is pretty bizarre is not it but i guess it is like well it is we have got the
[1257.52-1258.08] FEO072: yeah
[1261.62-1262.72] MEE071: that is very bizarre
[1263.72-1269.08] FEO072: so they do not you know they do not say look in that map folder but they say search everything
[1267.18-1268.30] MEE071: yeah yeah
[1270.52-1271.28] MEE071: that is very bizarre
[1272.76-1281.24] MEE073: well they did say it was not the most efficient
[1274.48-1279.18] FEO070: it does look quite grippy
[1277.56-1283.00] FEO072: it does load up quite quickly so it is not too bad but you know it can have a lot of
[1280.40-1289.98] FEO070: ok but you know it but what what is it like a window where you have to write a search query or is it just what is behind it so or what is what is
[1289.16-1289.96] FEO072: but it is worth
[1290.00-1291.52] FEO070: actual search this is just
[1290.00-1306.68] FEO072: actual search this is just when you open w you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for a certain meeting it does does an n x d search for the string i do not know transcript or text or whatever
[1295.20-1295.40] FEO070: yeah
[1297.00-1297.16] FEO070: yeah
[1306.04-1306.32] FEO070: ok
[1307.00-1313.68] MEE071: four and it what it like it just has an open variable transfer it to this whatever find everything that has got that and then load
[1310.70-1310.92] FEO072: yeah
[1313.24-1319.98] FEO072: yep so i do not know if you have looked at the search query language base like a dollar a
[1319.52-1319.96] MEE071: yeah ok
[1319.68-1319.88] FEO070: yeah
[1319.84-1320.00] MEE073: yeah
[1320.00-1320.72] FEO072: text say
[1320.00-1326.84] MEE071: yeah yeah cause that is the the guy could he could close a variable does not he when he keep opening it up
[1323.92-1330.08] FEO072: yeah and then yeah because every every all of these
[1331.44-1341.60] FEO072: these files have got an i d and all the transcript files got the string i do not know what it is words or text or something in it so it just searches for those files
[1342.38-1342.76] FEO070: ok
[1342.98-1343.40] MEE071: right
[1343.24-1343.68] FEO072: yeah you do
[1345.60-1350.00] FEO070: when you like is there a open thingy or
[1345.68-1345.96] FEO072: well you
[1350.00-1358.20] FEO070: why do like wha what did you do to like how did you figure out that this user is next to you search like is it
[1350.00-1350.28] FEO072: flag
[1357.48-1370.44] FEO072: is it well it is in the code just that it you know it you have you define a search object and then you search about the string i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing called a summary that is how i
[1361.22-1361.54] FEO070: ok
[1364.94-1365.24] FEO070: ok
[1371.96-1376.56] FEO072: i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself
[1372.12-1373.20] MEE071: so see i am
[1376.64-1379.28] MEE071: so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did
[1379.32-1379.98] FEO072: yeah
[1380.00-1383.00] FEO072: just search for a specific string
[1383.46-1383.80] MEE071: alright
[1385.36-1385.80] MEE071: thank you
[1385.40-1392.36] FEO072: so you could just you know you could use that when you if you want to take the data out yeah
[1391.32-1393.28] MEE071: pitched it over to i was just thinking that yeah
[1393.10-1393.46] FEO070: yeah
[1396.68-1405.56] FEO072: if you have a a question about what the the code means or where to find the code that you want to you know whatever you want to do then just send me an email
[1397.00-1397.36] FEO070: yeah
[1406.84-1407.66] FEO072: i can explain
[1408.28-1408.52] FEO070: yeah
[1408.84-1410.00] MEE071: have you annotated your code
[1410.00-1413.48] MEE071: nice oh yeah
[1410.72-1435.96] FEO072: oh yeah actually in the moment it has got a load of rubbish because the the the browsers that are used from this from you know that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in and i have not dared throw it out to throw out all the functions i have you know that i do not need yeah just in case exactly yes so they are all in there yeah still a lot of rubbish but it will be ge it will be chucked out by the end i think
[1411.64-1412.76] MEE073: yeah
[1424.84-1429.56] MEE071: just in case it is what they are doing mission critical yeah
[1425.04-1426.24] MEE073: i do not think so
[1436.92-1439.96] MEE071: comi commenting it out one bit at a time and running it cause it works
[1439.28-1439.98] FEO072: yes
[1439.76-1440.00] MEE073: yeah
[1440.00-1443.32] FEO072: that that yeah that is the
[1440.00-1447.08] MEE071: yeah good fun
[1440.00-1441.32] MEE073: yeah
[1452.00-1452.28] FEO070: yeah
[1452.08-1458.08] MEE071: so basically we go and kind this and work then yeah that is very cool ok
[1454.16-1455.76] MEE073: yeah sure sure only we can
[1455.44-1460.64] FEO072: yeah the weekend the weekend is still four days off
[1458.24-1458.88] MEE073: yeah oh
[1460.02-1468.38] MEE073: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how many how much is this
[1461.24-1466.00] MEE071: yeah we are still at the bottom of the mountain
[1465.04-1465.72] FEO072: yeah
[1467.52-1469.52] FEO072: i do not actually have that much to do at the moment
[1470.00-1484.08] MEE071: well should you phone him want to explore any other how how is your how is your quantifier raising yeah
[1471.24-1476.04] FEO072: well
[1472.52-1475.68] FEO070: yeah
[1473.76-1474.60] MEE073: yeah it is really fun
[1480.12-1482.92] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1483.08-1487.52] FEO072: i can not remember what i am supposed to do by the way am i supposed to do the summarisation thing you bought
[1493.18-1494.36] FEO070: no
[1494.00-1494.36] FEO072: no
[1495.54-1496.12] MEE073: who was doing it
[1499.32-1500.00] FEO072: you do
[1499.72-1500.00] MEE073: oh really
[1500.00-1503.00] FEO072: well i will do that then
[1500.60-1504.82] FEO070: well i will do that then
[1500.72-1501.92] MEE071: you can use that yeah
[1500.88-1501.00] MEE073: yeah
[1502.12-1512.20] MEE073: these can be changed in a minute i do not know it does not matter if if you want to i mean it is just you know play around with some extra stuff you have some time why not
[1504.40-1505.80] FEO072: shall i do that then i mean
[1507.00-1507.72] FEO072: well you know
[1512.36-1513.56] FEO072: it should not be too difficult
[1516.12-1516.40] FEO070: oh
[1516.90-1521.40] MEE071: so what courses should i have picked are we not doing any good
[1519.12-1524.12] FEO070: yeah well i am doing communications which
[1521.12-1530.00] FEO072: well i am doing communications which we had one exercise and i have done that like two weeks ago and that is in in two weeks
[1530.24-1537.70] MEE073: is that informatics courses yeah oh with like digital ok ok
[1532.88-1537.64] FEO072: yeah it is a nine nine calls or ten or something yeah
[1537.84-1539.00] MEE071: well i suppose that yeah
[1539.00-1547.80] FEO072: and then then i am doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that seemed like friday
[1551.52-1557.64] FEO072: well i am not doing any back hand things but you know so
[1557.24-1559.96] FEO070: yeah
[1561.64-1565.62] MEE073: yeah i will be happy when this week is over
[1564.32-1565.28] MEE071: yeah
[1565.12-1570.64] FEO070: have we have we wait please cut this over
[1567.12-1574.68] MEE073: yeah i do not know is that about it then anything else we need to discuss
[1571.84-1572.08] FEO070: yeah
[1576.52-1580.52] MEE073: did we want to meet before we talk to steve next week
[1582.98-1589.98] MEE073: well i do not know we will probably get some work done over the weekend so i know after d n l g or something maybe just have a little quick
[1586.72-1587.08] FEO070: yeah
[1590.00-1591.00] MEE073: but it will update and just
[1592.32-1599.94] FEO072: yeah if you like we can always decide then i think yeah yeah so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then
[1593.44-1594.36] FEO070: yeah we can
[1593.84-1596.28] MEE073: yeah well we can decide yeah exactly yeah
[1595.68-1595.96] FEO070: yeah
[1600.36-1619.98] MEE073: search and sh sh sh sh could not be that hard well it will be you know still a limited version of you know the next query but it will not be the whole thing but like we can just decide sort of the things that we do want to do yeah
[1602.04-1605.78] FEO072: you are going to do the search you are going to implement the search everything
[1604.96-1605.88] FEO070: yeah
[1607.60-1608.00] FEO070: yeah
[1620.00-1623.86] MEE073: well actually moza just dialed back something i suppose
[1620.68-1620.96] FEO072: yeah
[1631.08-1633.46] MEE073: similar topic structure
[1638.28-1638.56] MEE073: yeah
[1638.92-1642.94] FEO072: it is just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise
[1639.12-1639.56] FEO070: so
[1642.00-1642.24] MEE073: yeah
[1644.84-1645.32] FEO072: you know
[1647.32-1650.00] MEE073: yeah but it gets behind schedule yeah pretty quick
[1647.82-1649.00] FEO072: weasel combined
[1650.00-1655.82] MEE073: like like you are saying yeah well actually do we want to set a date for interim prototype
[1657.00-1658.18] MEE073: specifically a date
[1660.80-1661.44] FEO070: yes
[1661.46-1664.20] FEO072: well you decide i am not very much for that project
[1664.68-1665.60] MEE071: oh yeah
[1667.78-1680.00] FEO070: th e progress report is two twenty
[1672.96-1673.38] FEO072: oh
[1674.72-1675.02] FEO072: oh
[1675.36-1677.56] MEE071: so so what is that two weeks places
[1678.94-1680.00] FEO072: well how about
[1680.00-1681.84] FEO072: we would get it done by then i mean
[1682.80-1684.00] MEE071: yeah sure
[1684.44-1689.72] FEO072: then we can write about it in the in the interim report you know we have you know now we have got something to show
[1687.80-1688.18] FEO070: yeah
[1687.96-1690.56] MEE071: yeah ok so
[1699.24-1705.94] FEO070: just look at my own deadlines that is it yeah so
[1705.36-1708.24] FEO072: oh and the the search interface
[1710.84-1723.96] FEO072: maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for and then if you want you can give that to me and i will i will build you a nice you know a few tick boxes and drop down menus
[1717.20-1717.38] MEE073: yep
[1724.96-1731.84] FEO070: was not like what do you have now was not that pretty much that new freedom or was it just like that one
[1728.52-1728.92] FEO072: no
[1730.30-1740.00] FEO072: oh that is that is that does not exist that is completely cut and pasted that does not exist nicely done though
[1736.16-1737.62] FEO070: ok
[1740.00-1754.88] FEO072: in it it is actually all these all these things are are nicked from you know all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google online a screen shot of google
[1740.32-1746.20] FEO070: yeah it is quite impressive cause actually all these all these things are are mixed
[1740.56-1743.64] MEE071: yeah it is it is quite impressive
[1742.44-1744.16] MEE073: it is it is actually all the
[1752.76-1753.08] MEE073: yeah
[1755.08-1755.88] FEO070: oh
[1756.92-1762.64] FEO070: that is that i regret maybe you should make it exist then
[1759.62-1763.12] MEE071: that is got to be
[1759.76-1769.98] FEO072: it is just so much fun it is going to be a little difficult more difficult yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus is
[1770.00-1776.52] FEO072: stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on we never agreed on what we want to be able to search for
[1776.60-1777.64] MEE071: no it is noisy yeah
[1776.66-1779.62] MEE073: no no yeah we decided on that over the weekend
[1777.76-1778.20] FEO072: so
[1779.80-1789.28] FEO072: yeah do you want to you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do and then and then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really want to include
[1781.12-1781.30] MEE073: yeah
[1791.16-1791.40] MEE073: yeah
[1791.36-1796.04] FEO072: that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do
[1794.96-1795.60] MEE073: yeah
[1796.46-1796.74] FEO070: no
[1798.72-1800.00] FEO070: it would be nice to if i do not know
[1800.00-1809.86] FEO070: yeah and you can sort of show us a bit what you know already so we do not sort of have to do all the work again you know just like figuring out stuff
[1810.28-1813.78] MEE073: oh just like the basics like sure
[1810.60-1811.04] FEO072: no
[1812.12-1813.08] FEO072: no already what
[1813.92-1816.84] FEO070: just like accessing the corpus and stuff
[1816.28-1816.74] FEO072: oh
[1816.84-1829.98] MEE073: yeah just like all the unseeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you have done like just get a a quick look over and just yeah yeah or like like the the class paths all that sort of thing where you just just say ok well here is you know
[1823.06-1828.20] MEE071: can take a s s tutorial thing yeah
[1823.52-1823.72] FEO072: yep
[1824.68-1827.80] FEO070: yeah yeah
[1829.68-1830.00] FEO072: yep
[1830.00-1831.32] FEO072: yeah can do that
[1830.00-1833.32] MEE073: everything is basically all set up and then just yeah just jump right in
[1831.52-1831.80] FEO070: yeah
[1832.48-1834.32] FEO072: showing you the product the code
[1834.42-1834.64] MEE073: yeah
[1835.76-1842.92] MEE073: yeah so that is well yeah in the morning of course
[1835.94-1838.66] MEE071: yeah that is cool
[1836.04-1836.24] FEO072: yeah
[1841.00-1848.84] FEO072: oh yeah well there is some iron being taken inside your body you can not do anything
[1845.04-1859.96] MEE073: yeah yeah yeah well thing is yeah yeah something like that could happen any time cause yeah like my schedule is like a class break class break class you know that sort of thing so yeah i know exactly exactly that is what i am thinking so
[1856.32-1858.68] FEO072: yeah i thought it would not take an hour to spend an image
[1858.52-1859.28] FEO070: yeah
[1860.00-1860.36] FEO072: yeah
[1860.00-1864.80] MEE073: something like that and then if i have a classic and run off i will do whatever yeah ok
[1862.60-1862.92] FEO070: yeah
[1862.74-1867.06] FEO072: pick a time yeah ok
[1865.12-1866.32] FEO070: yeah
[1866.12-1868.22] MEE073: so monday monday might be good so
[1868.14-1868.40] FEO070: yeah
[1868.64-1870.80] FEO072: what monday what did you take
[1870.24-1871.12] MEE073: yeah

[1881.96-1882.12] MEE073: sure
[1884.28-1884.72] MEE073: possibly
[1885.36-1888.24] MEE071: it is not really easy alright there was no time to do an l g four was not there
[1886.92-1887.08] FEO070: yeah
[1888.34-1889.02] FEO070: it is for
[1888.84-1889.98] FEO072: unless you want to do it after the
[1889.12-1889.40] MEE073: yeah
[1890.00-1892.20] FEO072: after a few
[1891.56-1893.84] MEE073: yeah that is an option too after again
[1893.28-1893.68] FEO072: during a
[1895.32-1896.52] MEE073: sure
[1895.92-1900.08] MEE071: three is good though but we have well what what was your fair
[1896.08-1896.28] FEO070: ok
[1899.14-1905.48] MEE073: or three thirty i just yeah necessary necessary we should
[1903.40-1906.56] FEO070: ok
[1903.76-1904.68] FEO072: that is a good time
[1904.68-1913.76] MEE071: if th thirty in the in the computer room in here and if you just go through if you can not can you get in the front door oh we have not got a key do can none of you get in
[1907.24-1908.76] MEE073: actually we can not get in there though
[1910.52-1911.06] FEO070: ok
[1912.60-1918.12] MEE073: we well we can get in with three d through the the card the card board yeah
[1913.92-1915.16] FEO072: yeah well i am not
[1916.30-1917.08] FEO070: the card the card
[1918.60-1919.80] FEO072: i am not a fan of that yet
[1920.00-1926.00] MEE071: in here or if you find me i will show you where i will i will let us all in there and we can look on in there
[1920.04-1927.80] MEE073: how about if we take that to the yeah yeah yeah exactly
[1923.40-1928.08] FEO070: we can look at we can look now afterwards yeah
[1926.44-1930.82] MEE071: yeah yeah you do need to have a key for it like that thing it has got a lock the whole button
[1929.76-1937.56] MEE073: oh ok this is where i am going to put it which was asking steve about that whether we can get in there whether he is going to get us access into it
[1929.84-1930.18] FEO070: ok
[1932.20-1933.28] MEE071: yeah somebody else does
[1938.04-1940.28] FEO070: into what ok
[1938.68-1939.24] MEE073: the computer world
[1940.36-1947.96] MEE071: yeah it has only got it is crap it has only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite a good for our job cause it can also it is not very ergonomic people and you have to
[1942.92-1943.50] MEE073: but
[1945.12-1945.40] MEE073: we can
[1947.92-1949.60] MEE073: right is there a printer there too
[1949.76-1950.00] MEE071: yeah
[1950.00-1958.78] MEE071: s and there is a photocopier with the code on it yeah there is
[1952.68-1953.04] FEO072: really
[1953.96-1956.72] MEE073: yes right coming handy
[1954.72-1955.16] FEO072: really
[1956.80-1958.44] FEO072: well i am just
[1957.64-1960.88] FEO070: well i am just probably going to have to write it back
[1957.74-1965.76] MEE073: hey we could we could put up your assignment ok we want to yeah well the comments i am thinking
[1961.76-1965.24] FEO072: i have got it on my computer what else might i do
[1963.02-1963.26] FEO070: yeah
[1964.32-1964.64] FEO070: yeah
[1965.88-1967.64] FEO070: so what time do we save
[1968.08-1974.12] FEO072: i just think it is better to do it afterwards then we have all the time we need yeah then have half an hour and then we will eventually run out
[1968.08-1968.36] MEE073: yes
[1970.64-1973.48] MEE073: yeah that is true so after d l g yeah
[1971.00-1971.32] MEE071: oh right
[1971.36-1972.18] FEO070: yeah then half yeah
[1973.16-1973.68] MEE071: yeah
[1973.32-1979.04] FEO070: yeah ok
[1978.80-1980.00] MEE073: as long as d m l g does not go
[1980.00-1980.36] MEE073: like to
[1981.76-1984.70] MEE071: hopefully it is not that man so it might not matter
[1986.24-1994.52] FEO072: actually it is not even confirmed yet what she does not even know what she is talking about maybe it does not happen at all
[1988.68-1988.84] FEO070: what
[1988.92-1989.26] MEE073: oh
[1991.32-2003.08] FEO070: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no it is reading week next week it should be should it be well it is supposed to be next week it is week six next week
[1992.84-1993.08] MEE073: sounds
[1995.16-1996.66] MEE073: sounds like me yeah sounds like me
[1997.58-1998.16] FEO072: is it really
[1998.40-2001.72] MEE073: are you next week or next week
[2002.32-2002.88] FEO072: really
[2003.84-2004.10] MEE073: oh
[2004.08-2005.94] FEO072: i do not think we have a reading week though
[2005.54-2009.92] FEO070: i do not know we have one class at least when we like speech perception we do not have any like
[2006.94-2008.44] MEE073: yeah that is canceled
[2009.80-2010.00] MEE073: oh
[2010.00-2015.16] FEO070: is but i think we are having like all other classes so there is not a point in it
[2010.00-2010.28] MEE073: go
[2012.80-2018.72] FEO072: yeah i do not think there was an official i do not think there was an official one last semester i think it was just a back call day was not it
[2019.02-2021.88] MEE073: something like that i think one of a couple classes i canceled
[2020.16-2020.78] FEO070: i think
[2021.16-2026.72] MEE071: some classes did and some classes did not cause they did not really know what was going on
[2023.28-2026.50] MEE073: yeah exactly
[2023.48-2030.04] FEO070: yeah we should have been yeah i think the undergrads just had a we are up till late
[2026.64-2027.16] FEO072: no
[2028.12-2028.36] MEE073: yeah
[2029.62-2040.00] MEE073: it goes up to the professor whether they did it or not well i do not feel like it yeah i think yeah i think d i l will probably have one to make up for missing classes
[2034.36-2035.92] MEE071: no like a w yeah
[2040.00-2044.30] MEE073: d i l will probably have prices
[2040.58-2040.80] FEO070: what
[2042.24-2048.94] FEO070: yeah we will probably have yeah we will have just been last week yeah
[2047.20-2049.36] FEO072: ok that is me monday
[2048.08-2048.22] MEE073: yeah
[2050.36-2051.14] MEE071: done
[2050.48-2060.50] FEO070: yeah i guess that is it was there anything else do anyone want to like take care of this or should i take care of it
[2060.80-2062.48] MEE073: ok yeah
[2060.96-2061.72] MEE071: oh wait just
[2062.28-2067.30] FEO070: yeah i do not know if there was something oh i think he basically said
[2069.60-2069.98] FEO070: oh
[2070.00-2074.88] FEO070: the same things as in the comments if i could read it
[2078.04-2080.76] FEO070: maybe that
[2078.18-2081.92] MEE073: ok i have a couple
[2084.36-2087.30] MEE073: we really want multiple windows from a single app
[2088.78-2090.46] FEO070: i am just going to go up and take it
[2089.60-2092.40] MEE073: but most will probably want to go with defaults
[2094.40-2096.92] FEO070: yeah well that was pretty simple
[2094.68-2097.20] MEE073: yeah thanks i think you can
[2096.46-2098.96] MEE071: yeah i think the comments are the basically the same as what he said so
[2098.74-2100.00] MEE073: yeah exactly and just the other
[2098.92-2099.14] FEO070: oh
[2100.00-2104.92] MEE073: comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation
[2106.20-2108.60] MEE073: ok that is good i am terribly excited
[2107.84-2117.88] FEO070: well then we have and now we have seven percent of the personal go let us get good so we
[2109.84-2110.24] MEE073: ok
[2112.16-2117.24] MEE073: ok thanks
[2114.64-2116.80] MEE071: yeah
[2116.82-2118.98] FEO072: i think we need to t t be ok cable right
[2119.14-2123.92] FEO070: if you are ok with having exciting
[2120.08-2125.02] FEO072: we are having a
[2121.20-2122.96] MEE071: yeah i think
[2125.92-2127.68] MEE073: that is great
[2126.00-2127.68] MEE071: signing off on it
[2126.28-2129.88] FEO070: yeah
[2129.88-2129.98] MEE073: it
[2130.00-2130.24] MEE073: ok
[2131.48-2132.60] FEO072: shall we turn these off then or what

[2139.28-2142.36] FEO070: you should still here yes you are

============================================================
SESSION: EN2002b
============================================================

[   4.48-   4.60] FEO072: yeah
[   4.84-   4.96] MEE073: yeah
[  16.64-  16.92] MEE071: ok
[  24.24-  28.50] FEO070: and it looks most different than the other
[  29.08-  29.28] MEE073: so
[  32.60-  33.08] MEE073: and you can
[  36.04-  36.48] FEO070: ok
[  37.04-  38.16] MEE071: ok
[  39.04-  43.84] MEE073: i think i like to take notes this time i guess i will take notes this time
[  39.76-  39.92] FEO072: yeah
[  42.00-  43.72] FEO070: but ok
[  44.94-  46.12] MEE073: which is less of a sense
[  45.80-  46.96] FEO070: oh we are using the wrong
[  48.28-  59.98] MEE073: i am sure you guys first thing i just sort of did a really sort of brief you know version of what we have to do
[  58.72-  58.92] FEO070: yeah
[  60.00-  62.32] MEE073: ok
[  62.02-  62.52] FEO070: ok
[  82.44-  89.46] FEO070: very interesting start of the meeting
[  85.16-  85.74] MEE071: yes
[  93.22-  93.48] FEO072: ok
[  93.68-  93.92] MEE071: yep
[ 123.12- 124.14] FEO072: like the timeline
[ 124.70- 130.62] MEE073: actually for that i was just copying the one straight out of the other documents so it is all whatever an accurate thing
[ 137.44- 139.44] MEE071: ok yeah
[ 137.72- 139.68] MEE073: ok ok
[ 139.24- 142.96] FEO072: ok you see it oh sorry sorry
[ 141.12- 142.64] MEE073: oh sure sure sure
[ 142.20- 143.12] FEO070: yeah
[ 144.36- 149.96] FEO072: i am not sure if we need the outline of the prototype i mean what what we are going to put into the
[ 144.52- 144.84] MEE073: ok
[ 149.12- 149.98] MEE073: yeah
[ 150.00- 168.92] MEE073: well just sorta well the thing is yeah we are going to be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen shots and all that stuff yeah cause yeah well it is just something that he had mentioned in the in the previous like just to sorta have a prototype together and start just saying that you know we could potentially do that i mean it is not something we have to
[ 154.40- 157.48] FEO072: yeah because i mean that is basically what we are doing here is not it the whole
[ 167.42- 175.26] MEE071: yeah we can find something after this could be just some i think just just describe some screen shots or something
[ 170.46- 170.58] MEE073: yeah
[ 177.24- 179.96] MEE073: yeah sure like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i
[ 180.00- 191.42] MEE073: was doing i mean just throw the screen shots in there when you talk about what you are doing right it makes sense so yeah oh yes yeah oh actually i had that at the very end screen shots but that did not show up on the screen so it is not even there on the inside
[ 183.60- 185.98] MEE071: yeah you can either have screen shots and we can just ignore that yeah or you can
[ 191.60- 200.72] MEE071: yeah you can either have it yeah it is a screen shot there and stuff but you can either have screen shots by the thing each one or have just a bunch of them in one section as well
[ 194.28- 194.48] MEE073: yeah
[ 200.14- 209.32] MEE073: yes anyway so so yeah this is just a very general structure i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and
[ 208.88- 210.00] MEE071: yeah i
[ 210.00- 213.80] MEE071: written the topic segmentation one
[ 211.32- 211.88] MEE073: alright cool
[ 213.12- 229.52] MEE073: nice so i do not know if there is other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i mail it to you guys otherwise yeah did someone else want to throw it together actually i can probably still throw it together if you want put your parts into into this one
[ 222.74- 223.76] MEE071: no it is a boring one
[ 229.82- 233.76] MEE071: i think it is a pen it is should do it
[ 231.28- 233.48] MEE073: yeah perfectionist right
[ 231.68- 236.60] FEO072: yeah yes yeah
[ 235.12- 239.98] MEE073: right that is a good idea let us just cut out the middle man
[ 237.36- 239.96] FEO070: i think we should just cut out the middle man
[ 240.00- 250.92] FEO070: and i am being like you know the main speaker of english i think is in the program so
[ 240.00- 247.52] MEE071: i am going to try to put it on anyway so
[ 240.00- 244.40] MEE073: you get a chance to go to a row anyway
[ 253.46- 255.38] FEO070: yeah well i will see
[ 253.80- 259.18] FEO072: yeah well i mean it is up to you if you want to keep going with that i am happy to do some as well i have lots of time tonight
[ 260.46- 267.16] FEO072: and then i will we would send it to you and you can do the final revision
[ 264.08- 268.56] MEE071: you can you can you can prospect it and you can
[ 266.16- 270.00] FEO070: yeah i will look at it like when my if you
[ 270.00- 296.36] FEO070: usual working hours are like from twelve o clock to three o clock or something so i am always on line yeah right i am always on line but i am never on line in the morning so
[ 275.34- 285.92] FEO072: i know you are always online it always make me feel bad cause when i go to bed at like one you are still online
[ 275.48- 280.52] MEE073: i know you are always online it always make me feel bad because i when i
[ 286.22- 289.68] MEE071: s may i just leave your computer on maybe
[ 286.68- 292.00] MEE073: well just leave your computer on maybe
[ 289.20- 294.06] FEO072: yeah you pretend always busy so maybe
[ 296.84- 297.96] MEE073: yeah
[ 296.92- 299.98] FEO072: yeah
[ 300.00- 302.60] FEO070: yeah
[ 300.00- 303.48] FEO072: yeah so
[ 300.00- 302.38] MEE073: alright alright
[ 304.12- 306.50] MEE073: ok so i will send it up to you and then
[ 305.44- 305.76] FEO070: well
[ 307.64- 318.12] FEO070: yeah do what you want to do with it first and then i will ok ok yeah and i will send it out to you again so we will
[ 309.52- 309.84] MEE073: ok
[ 311.36- 313.88] MEE071: kay
[ 312.44- 312.76] FEO072: yeah
[ 313.28- 314.56] MEE073: ok
[ 316.20- 329.98] MEE073: was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline i mean essentially was what like you can not see it or anything else here is the old one well that is that is the original yeah yeah which just copied straight out
[ 320.72- 321.20] FEO072: yeah
[ 323.84- 328.12] FEO072: oh there is more oh i see oh this is the one that ok
[ 331.00- 345.72] FEO070: probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff i think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the audio files
[ 345.46- 349.08] FEO072: that is what i thought as well i mean do we are we are we actually going to attempt that
[ 346.96- 347.26] MEE073: yeah
[ 347.46- 348.18] MEE071: yeah
[ 348.20- 352.58] FEO070: it is no that is that is too big yeah
[ 349.72- 351.84] MEE071: yeah that is that is
[ 350.60- 355.76] FEO072: i do not think so either yeah i think that is going to be we do not even know how to approach that at the moment i think
[ 351.94- 352.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 355.60- 355.86] FEO070: no
[ 356.12- 356.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 357.38- 360.00] MEE071: it is a good thing to have to say we get what we could have done
[ 360.00- 368.72] MEE071: have we had more time good future work thing is not it stick in the conclusion to find the report should have we had more time then which we yeah
[ 363.30- 363.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 363.36- 363.68] FEO070: yeah
[ 365.92- 372.86] MEE073: yeah unless we discover some sort of time warp thing
[ 366.30- 389.00] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah yeah that is right i mean yeah so maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading but put it under changes since the initial specification and say yeah we did not we decided the the time is too short for that
[ 370.98- 373.52] MEE071: yeah
[ 372.96- 375.80] FEO070: yeah so maybe i mean
[ 380.14- 382.48] MEE073: yeah
[ 382.36- 382.72] FEO070: yeah
[ 385.04- 386.24] MEE071: yeah that would be a good thing for
[ 390.00- 391.36] MEE071: things that we would all talk about
[ 391.28- 391.72] FEO072: yes
[ 392.96- 394.20] MEE071: to wear it now
[ 393.36- 398.44] FEO072: we would prefer to concentrate on the main
[ 404.96- 410.96] FEO072: and i think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
[ 409.12- 409.48] MEE073: yeah
[ 411.12- 416.20] MEE073: yeah this this and this or some of them work a bit later somewhere yeah we could even
[ 412.52- 415.06] FEO072: meet these milestones yeah
[ 415.34- 417.82] MEE071: yeah that is good yeah that should have a section for that
[ 417.52- 419.36] FEO070: mike you have not used
[ 417.56- 419.98] FEO072: like yeah developer prototype gubi we t
[ 417.94- 418.28] MEE073: yeah
[ 419.68- 419.98] MEE073: yeah
[ 420.00- 424.46] FEO072: you know i i we manage that nicely and
[ 420.46- 420.80] FEO070: yeah
[ 421.32- 423.80] MEE073: it is not coming
[ 423.76- 426.00] MEE071: vest file on target or something
[ 425.60- 437.88] MEE073: so yeah yeah yeah it is very well it it it does not have to know exactly
[ 426.08- 428.56] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah but that is not good
[ 428.00- 435.66] MEE071: it it it does not have to know exactly
[ 430.80- 449.08] FEO070: it i it does not have to know exactly what it is going to do i mean yeah i am not i mean it is not finished but it is a technician
[ 441.08- 445.94] MEE071: it is i have only got six days to do the topic segment
[ 441.76- 442.48] FEO072: just section
[ 444.56- 449.98] MEE073: i do not know you do not have any s p l p s i m s d
[ 449.48- 449.98] MEE071: yeah
[ 450.00- 452.36] MEE071: yeah
[ 452.12- 460.88] FEO072: and you can say yeah we are say we are still aiming for the development to be completely maturated or something
[ 454.38- 455.76] MEE071: speaking characterizing
[ 457.48- 458.02] MEE071: jesus
[ 460.16- 465.76] MEE071: speaking characterizing is supposed to be done already yeah two days ago
[ 462.40- 471.18] MEE073: oh really for one of those something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations
[ 463.74- 464.40] FEO072: oh
[ 472.98- 475.92] MEE071: give me a week and i will tell you the answer today
[ 473.92- 478.98] MEE073: ok like should we put a a hint that something like that might happen into the document
[ 474.84- 475.84] FEO072: i yeah i
[ 479.00- 479.98] MEE071: maybe they are speaking
[ 480.00- 481.44] MEE071: characterization may get slimmer
[ 481.88- 495.24] FEO072: yeah that is right i d i really want to do it i mean it is not w it is not going to be difficult if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta data file that is going to be new worked so it is definitely going to be something then
[ 481.96- 485.88] MEE073: yeah that is right i d i really want to do it i mean it is not yeah
[ 483.22- 485.80] MEE071: probably we might not disappear but yeah
[ 491.28- 493.64] MEE073: ok yeah true yeah
[ 492.24- 493.32] MEE071: ok
[ 495.32- 497.80] MEE071: yeah we might not make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
[ 495.42- 496.40] MEE073: ok
[ 496.04- 496.18] FEO070: yeah
[ 499.20- 503.12] MEE071: but we might not you do not know we might have time to put it on yeah i do not know how things
[ 501.30- 504.84] FEO072: yeah we might turn out either the fork or
[ 508.60- 509.98] MEE071: the topic segmentation with
[ 510.00- 523.00] MEE071: l c segan textiles basically done just needs to be done yeah yeah a search of the parameters but it is manual or something and see what happens
[ 513.64- 517.76] MEE073: ok
[ 522.48- 522.72] MEE073: ok
[ 526.60- 527.42] FEO072: yeah that was good
[ 530.14- 530.60] FEO072: it was
[ 530.52- 530.68] MEE073: ok
[ 534.30- 534.52] FEO070: yeah
[ 536.78- 539.96] FEO070: shall we shall we sorry we should probably
[ 537.76- 539.96] FEO072: we should probably sorry we should probably
[ 540.00- 540.16] FEO070: me
[ 540.00- 549.60] FEO072: we do not have the responsibility of packages as well that is what he hinted that we should also indicate who who is responsible for what from now on
[ 548.32- 557.68] MEE073: right well i could probably just copy that straight away as well that is essentially the same as it was more detailed specifically
[ 552.40- 553.44] MEE071: yeah i think
[ 557.64- 560.02] FEO072: well you could put you know you know whatever
[ 567.92- 570.00] FEO070: shall we i do not know
[ 570.00- 580.70] FEO070: you think mike but our things that we have together should we i mean no yeah i mean we have like a parted and you have the other but what about the
[ 575.04- 580.16] MEE073: split those apart yeah that thing is like yellow yeah i am very far yeah exactly
[ 582.48- 585.88] FEO070: i am not in this conversation should we just
[ 583.52- 588.06] MEE073: oh well if we are skipping the audio one then things are not easier
[ 587.72- 593.72] FEO070: yeah we just keep it together on the the paper there right now and just see what what
[ 589.80- 599.14] MEE073: yeah yeah have you taken any more for the cutting have you taken any more of a look at it have the display ok right ok we could probably
[ 595.64- 598.72] FEO070: no not the discussion yeah
[ 601.68- 611.48] MEE073: i know we will have time to look at that before tomorrow we could just make it up like i will claim one you claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one
[ 603.88- 606.96] FEO070: yeah it might be yeah
[ 606.76- 607.40] FEO072: so
[ 612.24- 612.44] FEO070: yeah
[ 612.96- 614.00] MEE073: and we will be good ok
[ 614.42- 614.86] FEO070: something
[ 614.96- 617.68] FEO072: have you managed any further on the search thing
[ 617.80- 630.00] MEE073: i found finally today something that i can build it in and it i should have something for tomorrow i should at you know at least very least have a a gooey and a wire i will be wiring it
[ 627.98- 629.72] FEO072: alright that is nice
[ 630.00- 639.80] MEE073: and hopefully tomorrow morning so i want to get something i want to see this i want to get it together have an image in my mind and i just want to see it on the thing and then give it a screen shot so
[ 636.12- 637.08] FEO072: yeah
[ 639.40- 639.64] FEO070: yeah
[ 642.16- 653.48] FEO070: yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more as well so i do not know if we send it in in the afternoon maybe i can add a few sentences to what i have done
[ 649.52- 660.00] MEE073: well well does not really matter i mean you can write the sentences first as well i mean with the intention that this is not i mean else
[ 658.08- 659.20] MEE071: yeah this is going to
[ 658.90- 660.00] FEO070: then it is done yeah
[ 660.00- 663.40] FEO070: is that him hopefully or maybe ok
[ 660.00- 668.02] MEE073: sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too when you write down the words and the idea is as oh ok we will do this something else awful too
[ 666.24- 668.00] FEO070: yeah yeah we will see
[ 668.24- 674.74] MEE071: how about the underlying data for it for the inverted file how does that come out then
[ 674.04- 674.32] MEE073: oh
[ 675.84- 690.00] FEO070: well i still like struggling with java stuff and yeah but welcome welcome to i think i was wondering about that is i have not looked at it so much but if if we can maybe
[ 679.40- 679.72] MEE073: alright
[ 681.40- 682.04] MEE071: kind of
[ 690.00- 701.94] FEO070: you guys know how we could do the like from the extract words that you did like also in in extract time stamps or something is it
[ 700.70- 720.00] MEE071: easy yeah just yeah well just when he pulls up the segments part of that one of the f one of the attributes if you do get attributes you can call the method get attributes it returns a list of attributes search through those and then just you can that will tell you what attributes it has got and then you can either do it all
[ 705.52- 705.84] FEO070: yeah
[ 711.94- 712.36] FEO070: ok
[ 718.84- 719.20] FEO070: ok
[ 720.00- 735.34] MEE071: automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the time stamps so you just say get attribute import i think it is i think the mat is called get attribute and it is it is called start time and end time and that will tell you the start times and end times i think it would say that is a double
[ 729.76- 730.10] FEO070: ok
[ 731.78- 732.12] FEO070: ok
[ 734.04- 734.32] FEO070: ok
[ 736.40- 736.74] FEO070: ok
[ 737.80- 742.64] FEO072: so is there did you have you made a another end browser is there something that i should
[ 741.00- 743.62] FEO070: yeah so now i can just put it in or something
[ 742.04- 743.84] MEE073: there is but i have not made a lot of changes to it so i might just delete what i have done and copy again from yours cause i am sure i am going to delete it
[ 744.48- 749.98] MEE071: yeah that is on the the the the non right elements the the the
[ 745.04- 746.06] FEO070: so it is on something yeah
[ 748.44- 748.92] FEO070: what on the
[ 750.00- 752.30] MEE071: the object is a non right element i think
[ 750.00- 779.92] MEE073: you have probably made some changes already oh since friday ok i thought you said ok alright i see ok i thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were kinda excellent on the weekend or something ok alright alright alright ok yeah yeah so yeah although there is stuff out there that actually i am going to try and minimize the amount of changes i make to m browser anyways should
[ 752.20- 756.72] FEO072: not since you did not do it last you know but i worked the night that is why
[ 752.24- 752.64] FEO070: ok
[ 756.40- 757.74] MEE071: that is a turn turn away thing
[ 757.76- 759.64] FEO070: yeah i will check it
[ 765.06- 772.52] FEO072: no after weekend after
[ 780.00- 810.00] MEE073: should not be an issue actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as we want to see other summaries do we want separate result panes for each of those or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are so that when they you know click on that it is going to go to the relevant thing like just if they check all three say topics summary and all of that have three different windows come up
[ 807.44- 808.50] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 811.48- 813.60] MEE073: or three like sub sub things sort of
[ 812.12- 823.44] FEO072: well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up or is that a a second result of pain or is there a you know does the window get larger so you know
[ 820.40- 838.00] MEE073: what i think what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window so it will be on the search window bottom half of the search window i do not know if we still want to keep it that way but that is that is what it is going to be working with so so it is just like you click those and it just loads up
[ 834.64- 835.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 838.48- 839.86] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 840.00- 852.32] MEE073: three or whatever it is one two or three depending on which ones you check and then so if we want to do it that way you know like it probably does not matter too much just try and think if there is going to be any other issues down the road depending on
[ 850.08- 850.70] FEO072: yeah
[ 852.40- 858.46] MEE071: well have you confused me do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of result
[ 858.12- 869.98] MEE073: no just just panes just result panes no no no no no no no so so so it is just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we want to search then it will well yeah they are
[ 860.20- 865.28] MEE071: ok not not three different ok ok right
[ 865.04- 866.28] FEO070: so
[ 867.70- 867.86] MEE071: yeah
[ 870.00- 879.14] MEE073: be two result panes so for for topics one and f i do not know not really tabs but then you can not see all of them at the same time and it is just like
[ 871.32- 873.00] MEE071: yeah it is off the the top is fine
[ 874.04- 876.84] FEO072: yeah i quite like the idea of a tab in that case
[ 877.56- 878.64] FEO070: all at the same time
[ 878.56- 883.56] FEO072: but you would not want to compare the result the topi one topic result with one summary result ok
[ 883.00- 887.82] MEE073: well it is no but the thing is if you are looking if you could check them both you are going to see all the results
[ 886.52- 891.68] FEO072: actually yeah especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting
[ 888.40- 889.60] MEE071: yeah yeah it is two things
[ 891.78- 900.00] MEE073: yeah exactly yeah so like somewhere you had the topic and then transcript it so or we could just put them all into one room
[ 892.92- 895.58] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah yeah that is true
[ 900.00- 903.08] MEE073: result ping on that same window and just indicate
[ 900.80- 904.92] FEO072: yeah i mean we could we could order them by meeting for example
[ 904.92- 912.96] MEE073: oh yeah i guess that is the other thing whether we want to have us reorder by columns or not well that is an answer yeah it is a lot of
[ 908.48- 916.58] FEO072: how do i order them yeah well i mean if you know that is y even the second step the first question is do we want to order them how do we want to order them in the first place
[ 916.52- 925.96] MEE073: yeah i think yeah probably by meeting it makes most sense i mean essentially they are temp you know in time order so yeah that kinda makes most sense
[ 920.34- 920.82] FEO072: yeah
[ 927.24- 928.44] FEO072: yeah maybe we should do that
[ 927.68- 928.28] MEE073: yeah
[ 929.60- 929.98] MEE073: yeah
[ 930.00- 935.84] MEE073: yeah should be an easy one now i do not know should should be fair ones i guess
[ 952.04- 954.32] FEO072: yeah why do not you just
[ 955.44- 956.38] FEO072: color code those
[ 957.48- 957.76] MEE073: yeah
[ 957.96- 958.92] FEO072: the results to consider the color code
[ 958.88- 960.00] MEE073: thinkin sometimes it can
[ 960.00- 985.80] MEE073: is like that like a run across in other languages just that it is hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it is put into like a list box or something it is hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever and then if we are highlighting something in a transcript window it may be difficult to get that information back once it is just in a list box an item in a list box so that is that is where is it coming from
[ 983.48- 984.28] FEO072: no but if you
[ 990.00- 999.32] FEO072: if statement saying straight on the you know rock bottom level saying if th if you found a segment then color it print it in red or whatever
[ 996.28- 996.52] MEE073: yeah
[ 997.72- 997.98] MEE073: right
[ 999.22-1001.08] MEE073: yeah yeah it is just it is
[1000.84-1001.70] FEO072: as opposed to
[1002.64-1019.98] MEE073: yeah yeah it is just like from past experience i have there is goofy little things that happen and it just does not let you save certain things and it is just kinda trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window so if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic i have this
[1008.84-1009.24] FEO072: so
[1011.38-1013.32] FEO072: well well how
[1019.92-1020.00] FEO072: oh
[1020.00-1020.88] FEO072: oh
[1020.00-1028.78] MEE073: mean at that point that is sort of where it starts getting a little bit tricky cause you are working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is and
[1023.36-1024.52] FEO072: yeah yeah i agree with that
[1028.76-1030.14] FEO072: oh oh i see yeah
[1030.24-1040.60] MEE073: so there are ways around it but you know whether we will be able to figure something out like that til before tomorrow you know or delegates or whatever what is the thing is
[1033.56-1035.44] FEO072: y you have to use actions
[1039.54-1045.84] FEO072: yeah i mean at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window does not it
[1045.72-1046.56] MEE073: right
[1047.16-1047.66] FEO072: so
[1048.52-1049.96] MEE073: i think he was saying that as long as we
[1050.00-1073.32] MEE073: implement that interface it should work with anything that we do like highlighting like you know i think that was who was saying that was not jonathan saying something about that i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window we should be able to have that highlighting happening anyways
[1060.08-1061.44] FEO072: what do you mean it should work with the
[1074.96-1075.24] MEE073: ok
[1075.72-1080.00] FEO072: yeah i mean the whole the what fills the transcription
[1079.36-1079.92] MEE071: it is all a noise
[1080.00-1087.12] FEO072: box and all of these boxes is a special sort of paint made by night so i am not sure what it is called now
[1080.00-1082.24] MEE071: text plane or something you mean is it
[1084.86-1085.40] MEE073: ok
[1086.92-1089.56] MEE071: text area text area
[1089.52-1090.92] FEO072: some
[1091.40-1093.64] MEE071: i am not texting my only thing is called norm yeah
[1092.12-1105.92] FEO072: i do not know what it is called and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well as i say and you know if you if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically so maybe it comes with something clever as well
[1095.32-1104.20] MEE071: night object model i think night object model i think that is what i do
[1098.52-1100.12] MEE073: ok ok alright
[1099.12-1099.74] FEO070: what
[1102.98-1103.34] MEE073: ok
[1104.76-1109.68] MEE073: ok maybe i should maybe i should use that as well anyway yeah ok
[1105.40-1106.82] FEO070: ok
[1108.12-1108.56] FEO072: yeah
[1111.48-1115.04] FEO072: no i am sure there is a lot of pain in it but no
[1116.36-1127.20] FEO072: i do not know text text yeah i do not know what you can yeah non text i do not know what you can yeah what what is a knob anyway
[1118.68-1119.56] MEE071: with the
[1120.48-1120.80] MEE073: no
[1121.32-1136.76] MEE071: the removing the disabilities have you done anything with that yet because i was wondering how we are going to write it back to h t m l i mean x m l if we take if we did the processing
[1124.06-1125.20] MEE073: no why
[1127.04-1128.72] MEE073: ok that should make sense
[1138.28-1139.72] MEE071: writing it back to x m l
[1145.76-1146.92] MEE071: it is a blog of text
[1148.18-1148.72] MEE071: text file
[1153.98-1162.32] MEE071: you will very much limit what you can do with it if it is not an x and l format actually there is some bizarre method that puts things back into x and l format
[1156.32-1157.36] FEO070: yeah that is true
[1168.28-1168.56] MEE073: right
[1169.68-1170.00] MEE073: f
[1170.00-1183.40] MEE073: f i thought we were just going to have that as words like not even not as x m l just sort of as a what was that though well transcript oh no transcript no cause then we need all the other data from the keep it a transcript
[1170.28-1170.72] MEE071: what
[1171.40-1171.94] FEO070: yeah
[1173.12-1178.10] MEE071: oh select what we want just take bits of the x m l and take only take certain segments
[1177.24-1178.26] FEO070: yeah only only
[1183.84-1189.62] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah certain segments ok yeah yeah alright
[1184.70-1185.02] MEE073: oh
[1185.08-1185.34] FEO070: yeah
[1186.36-1188.14] MEE073: yeah that is true yeah point
[1188.04-1188.58] FEO070: ok
[1191.24-1192.36] MEE071: ok that
[1191.44-1198.56] FEO072: why do you why do we want it in x m l though i mean i thought we we just selectively selectively write the x m l that we have got
[1192.88-1195.22] FEO070: yeah that is just a nice amount yeah
[1194.58-1196.32] MEE071: it says something different there that is what
[1196.50-1196.82] FEO070: ok
[1197.88-1200.00] MEE071: then written to a written to a file or something
[1200.00-1206.24] MEE071: so it would ever be done but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no like cause you can do things on word level so yeah that is fine
[1201.12-1202.84] FEO072: so as as opposed to
[1205.78-1206.12] FEO072: yeah
[1207.20-1221.18] FEO072: yeah only only print out certain certain segments and segments that we want just selectively at the moment it prints out all of them we will just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print segments yeah not not store it at all whatsoever
[1208.48-1208.90] MEE071: yeah
[1208.96-1211.48] FEO070: wait we are not really well i mean
[1212.90-1215.72] FEO070: we are not going to do much more than just look at the
[1217.16-1224.50] FEO070: the room like the text for remote dissonances cause we are not going to search it and we are not going to like listen to it
[1222.52-1229.96] MEE073: oh yeah ok the nice the nice mount yeah yeah i know that is sort of what we were thinking before actually but this makes more
[1223.28-1223.76] FEO072: these are s
[1226.44-1228.16] FEO070: cause we are not doing the audio thing
[1227.24-1227.88] FEO072: oh right
[1229.52-1229.88] MEE071: yeah
[1230.00-1235.04] FEO070: so i guess just displaying it is alright but yeah yeah you do not really
[1233.16-1235.12] MEE071: this one is touch
[1236.08-1236.34] FEO070: no
[1236.24-1239.90] MEE073: yeah if we are going to do the x m l then fine that is not a problem so just
[1236.60-1237.48] MEE071: yeah but it will
[1243.00-1249.94] MEE071: it would just be a blurb like a summary it will not look like it will not say speaker x says this speaker y says that speaker z says that
[1248.72-1249.28] FEO070: yes
[1252.40-1257.26] MEE071: yeah then it will look ugly probably cause it will look just black and white unless you want to start climbing
[1255.44-1255.74] FEO072: yeah
[1256.76-1259.98] FEO070: it is probably best to do as you said like just
[1260.00-1263.26] FEO070: it is going to take long to to produce anyway it is just another
[1260.48-1261.02] FEO072: so i guess
[1261.64-1263.84] MEE071: i do not know i do not think it is true
[1263.44-1264.34] MEE073: that is text file
[1264.04-1266.94] FEO072: yeah yeah you do not really need to do much more with it yeah that is right
[1267.04-1274.72] MEE073: but the thing is like well how would we display that like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know create a text file take the disfluency out of the text file and then
[1272.36-1273.76] MEE071: it does it on the file anyway does not it
[1275.12-1278.58] MEE071: so then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint
[1279.32-1279.50] FEO070: yeah
[1279.68-1286.30] MEE073: unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file yeah that is a true thing
[1281.84-1283.20] MEE071: just a bunch of list items
[1289.32-1289.98] FEO072: just
[1290.00-1301.12] FEO072: is going to take long to to produce anyway it is just another i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it is just words and to print all of them out selectively
[1304.08-1304.48] FEO072: yeah
[1305.00-1311.28] MEE071: yeah you probably could actually that is probably not that s more difficult you just need to fatten the code out a bit with with the same thing
[1309.46-1309.74] FEO072: yeah
[1314.16-1320.00] FEO072: you could nearly do it together with with the the transcription with the original transcription have more on power
[1320.00-1320.16] FEO072: well
[1321.88-1332.28] FEO072: so if certain you know if it is a proper word print it on both both panes and if it is not a proper word then print it any i want but i mean that is that is you know fancy but
[1323.00-1325.08] MEE071: and they can yeah it is ok
[1334.92-1335.54] FEO072: but
[1337.24-1337.70] FEO072: yeah
[1339.52-1341.36] FEO072: yeah but then
[1340.14-1346.96] MEE071: should not i it is just that they would just be if statements would not they do not have last if statements i guess
[1342.52-1350.00] FEO072: you know the the b the good way of doing it not together is that you if someone does not want to look at the
[1350.00-1354.08] FEO072: the the you know the chop file then you do not ever have to produce it
[1350.00-1361.36] MEE071: have to put it take a quick look into x m l with java even trying to read it in x m l with java was complicated enough i gave up to it and that completely developed it back to n night stuff cause it was not too much much easier
[1356.00-1371.40] FEO072: so but i mean you can you know you can write we can write something like well try and do an on the fly and and observe if if that is going to is going to take too long if it is going to take too long well think about writing it to a file and doing it offline
[1362.80-1369.68] MEE071: so we can do it with night stuff do it with night stuff i think otherwise it could have been java trying to do it with java it was just so complicated it was really
[1367.60-1367.84] MEE073: yeah
[1370.92-1371.08] MEE073: yeah
[1371.80-1380.00] MEE071: i do not believe it you have to start defining object models like the night thing and getting all bizarre weird things
[1373.00-1373.84] FEO072: yeah
[1373.04-1380.00] MEE073: yeah or i was just thinking as well i mean you could probably even use like x s l t to kind of just transform it and
[1380.00-1380.92] MEE071: so it is here
[1380.00-1409.92] MEE073: you know flip it into just transforms like a style sheet x m l style sheet and then it is kind of like there is usually things built in to well it should be built into java i mean to process x m l into like it just creates whatever file it is going to be in i do not know it has been a f couple of years since i have looked at anything like this but that might even be an easier way and then that way we could even pre process that before and i do not know well we do not want to have to do that right although i
[1391.46-1391.84] FEO072: yeah
[1410.00-1412.16] MEE073: the file is typically it is typically pretty
[1415.32-1419.16] MEE073: oh really ok
[1424.44-1426.00] MEE073: yeah ok alright
[1429.00-1431.92] MEE073: ok
[1435.52-1437.32] MEE073: ok this is serious
[1438.96-1439.44] MEE073: sensei
[1441.68-1468.26] MEE073: i actually i was thinking i might try and talk to who is it jonathan and jean like just to see what they what system they use to develop this stuff cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system you know at a higher level rather than kinda you know playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that it would be nice to just sort of see what they are doing so i might try and contact them see if there is if i do not know
[1448.56-1450.32] FEO070: well i mean
[1458.80-1461.04] FEO072: that is what the program is all about i am afraid
[1469.64-1470.00] MEE073: any other
[1470.00-1475.40] MEE073: hence the gigabitless just to get things i do not know moving at a higher level i guess
[1471.60-1474.32] FEO072: yeah maybe it is the higher people
[1476.88-1481.36] MEE073: it seems to be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would
[1478.94-1479.68] FEO072: well i mean
[1480.88-1495.26] FEO072: yeah why do not you put both of both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you will have a look at both of something if you want to do it i i personally do not want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment i want to do it superficially
[1483.04-1487.60] MEE073: it could just seem to like a little tinkering here and there and just adding a couple things and
[1488.68-1489.40] MEE071: i expect it will be
[1488.88-1489.28] MEE073: that is all
[1490.76-1500.00] MEE073: no no it should not be no it should be higher level it should be conceptual and you know coming up with the brilliant ideas and then just yeah
[1499.08-1500.00] MEE071: yeah it is high s
[1500.00-1500.84] MEE071: after it is loaded
[1500.00-1508.10] MEE073: bringing those to reality yeah
[1502.36-1504.94] MEE071: it is just a it is just a four loop really it is going to be fine yeah
[1503.14-1503.48] FEO072: yeah
[1506.80-1507.24] MEE071: yeah
[1518.06-1518.48] FEO072: yeah
[1518.90-1521.52] MEE071: yeah i am clear to the future work in my own section but
[1522.82-1527.76] MEE071: i just said i said what i have done so far and what i am going to do and some pr some issues
[1526.44-1527.96] FEO072: well it has already loaded it anyway
[1528.64-1530.00] MEE073: like the thing that i was thinking there as well
[1530.00-1547.48] MEE073: well as a once it is done for a f you know one meeting it is done it is there it is a file text file or x m l or whatever it is but yeah just i do not know it just it does not make any difference really either way to me it is like you know if it is fast enough on the fly then sure that is about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it is fast enough
[1532.74-1533.68] MEE071: so you can lose the
[1534.16-1535.08] FEO072: yeah yeah
[1535.60-1543.80] MEE071: you might lose a bit of continuity if you do that there also i was thinking sometimes it is easier to have the top in its own instructions if you so mean so you talk about speech characteristics in speech only
[1536.32-1536.68] FEO070: yeah
[1543.86-1547.30] FEO072: so shall we all write a letter or two about future work as well
[1548.80-1548.92] MEE073: yeah
[1549.12-1549.96] FEO072: yeah
[1549.56-1556.48] MEE073: especially with java and all those other crap that is just if it is loading the file and doing all this and processing it
[1549.84-1559.96] MEE071: goals or something something bullet bullet bullet points yeah because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing here they are not together you lose a lot of the continuity
[1551.80-1552.12] FEO072: alright
[1555.20-1556.74] FEO072: yeah well maybe you could
[1558.00-1559.32] FEO072: maybe you could split that up and
[1558.08-1558.36] MEE073: yeah
[1560.00-1560.60] MEE071: right
[1562.80-1566.28] FEO072: yeah like here is what we have done already and then you know down here
[1564.22-1564.98] MEE073: yeah i am fine yeah
[1565.00-1568.68] MEE073: with a run through the memory
[1572.72-1573.36] FEO072: yeah
[1579.20-1579.54] FEO072: maybe
[1581.08-1583.96] FEO072: yeah that is right yeah yeah maybe maybe
[1581.80-1582.14] MEE073: yeah
[1587.28-1589.22] MEE073: right and it is actually the other thing is
[1589.30-1590.00] FEO072: yeah maybe
[1590.00-1591.14] FEO072: right yeah
[1590.56-1593.80] MEE073: i will like into each yeah
[1595.22-1596.76] MEE071: so performance yeah
[1601.44-1612.04] MEE073: yeah i agree i think that does make sense but maybe at the end maybe just a a point form of you know things that we are still working on things that we do yeah yeah yeah
[1610.92-1615.36] FEO070: yeah
[1611.52-1611.72] MEE071: ok
[1617.12-1618.00] MEE073: yeah i know what you mean
[1619.68-1619.98] MEE073: that is a
[1620.00-1622.24] MEE073: that is it
[1623.32-1630.92] FEO072: sounds good anything else anyone wants to talk about we all have sleep already
[1626.88-1627.88] FEO070: what
[1630.28-1633.56] FEO070: i do not know it does not matter to me either but
[1633.64-1634.26] FEO072: burns out
[1636.92-1640.72] FEO070: yeah i mean yeah yeah
[1637.24-1649.98] FEO072: well maybe a sleep yeah so we are all still writing our some
[1637.44-1639.00] MEE071: yeah
[1643.08-1646.60] FEO070: yeah
[1643.12-1643.52] MEE071: yeah
[1646.48-1646.68] MEE071: yeah
[1650.00-1657.04] FEO070: well i am not even making sure what i am saying it is like no i am just trying to figure it out
[1650.00-1652.28] FEO072: mary is sending them to you you send it on to the
[1651.12-1652.12] MEE073: so
[1651.72-1652.08] MEE071: ok
[1655.04-1655.96] MEE073: so
[1655.08-1656.68] MEE071: i will do you
[1655.32-1656.16] FEO072: how kind are you
[1660.66-1660.96] FEO070: yeah
[1662.84-1680.00] FEO070: yeah
[1667.04-1667.44] FEO072: yeah
[1668.08-1675.56] MEE073: yeah
[1669.64-1676.48] FEO072: yeah and then send it on to us so that we can not
[1674.44-1677.00] MEE071: oh my god
[1681.16-1683.56] FEO070: yeah
[1681.66-1697.28] MEE073: or or she will just take she can take that from me does not matter or or no or ok i c i can yeah sure if you want to send them to you that is fine yeah ok actually no no no actually that is a good idea i will take one quick look over try and get it as good as i think that way yeah
[1684.86-1694.52] FEO072: ok sounds good i have not used my pen
[1692.72-1696.60] MEE071: twelve things are right here that was a little idea there is not it
[1699.40-1699.72] MEE073: ok
[1704.74-1706.28] MEE073: can only a few minutes yeah
[1705.68-1706.34] FEO072: oh god
[1711.88-1716.48] MEE073: yeah they were changing dialog back to
[1716.76-1720.24] MEE073: ok
[1722.32-1722.68] MEE073: oh
[1724.76-1725.82] MEE073: oh hell
[1729.32-1729.96] MEE073: ok
[1733.84-1735.44] MEE073: oh oh my god
[1739.08-1739.98] MEE073: oh is that
[1740.00-1741.80] MEE073: ok

============================================================
SESSION: EN2002c
============================================================

[  20.64-  27.56] MEE071: oh sorry does it squeeze in like that yeah yeah it makes sense
[  37.78-  38.48] MEE071: ok
[  46.46-  46.72] MEE071: right
[  47.04-  51.48] MEE073: do you want to do any comments
[  53.28-  56.56] FEO072: did we get a seven hour term for real
[  54.96-  59.36] MEE071: yep it is going to was a given by a through
[  61.32-  62.04] MEE073: oh ok
[  64.56-  65.24] MEE073: ok
[  67.08-  67.30] MEE071: sure
[  67.08-  68.20] MEE073: ok that is good
[  67.60-  67.92] FEO072: ok
[  91.88-  93.52] MEE071: do i just sit on the side of the thing cause you just sit through the sh
[  93.84-  94.20] MEE073: yeah
[  98.40-  99.28] FEO072: yep
[ 103.84- 103.98] MEE073: kay
[ 103.96- 105.16] MEE071: so how are we getting along
[ 107.14- 107.60] FEO072: oh my
[ 107.68- 120.00] MEE073: one thing that i was wondering is there a standard control that you use to connect the different things like you are in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever
[ 120.00- 127.12] MEE073: is there a particular type of control that like is there one of these n x t or sorry nite controls no m or
[ 125.08- 148.40] FEO072: i think there is just because the the topic box and all this is is based on what was it called non no night text area or something in text area as always it has some sort of highlighted stuff there so you should probably look at the
[ 140.86- 141.40] MEE073: ok
[ 155.36- 157.32] FEO072: i am not sure if it is in belt date to be honest
[ 157.92- 173.38] MEE073: you have not had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing like other topics or and what we are going to do with our speaker i guess in the following direction or no well ok when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
[ 166.68- 167.88] FEO072: well well
[ 173.38- 179.98] MEE071: d i want to talk about that actually the speaker the data processing is fine but i would not particularly want to do the
[ 180.00- 209.96] MEE071: the gooey for it no not really if some of you want to do that n n tell me how you want data presented how cause do you want me to tell you because it is moment re is i have created two classes one that represents speakers one that represents meetings and meet and information about both is contained within each object so and n y re it writes objects and objects contain all information about meetings and speakers so that n who speaker
[ 181.40- 181.62] MEE073: yeah
[ 182.50- 188.68] FEO072: you do not ok ok yeah i was thinking about i was getting that question right
[ 185.20- 185.52] MEE073: ok
[ 190.52- 190.92] FEO072: yeah
[ 193.64- 204.92] MEE073: ok
[ 205.20- 205.56] MEE073: ch
[ 210.00- 235.34] MEE071: is that they are at the meetings and they have they speak and then the average is a container of the speakers so there is t two separate classes do you see what i mean and they are they are two different objects and you can really co they can write the write to the objects and then you call the objects back and they have those returned objects have all the information that they need and then you can call methods to r return whatever you want or everything but that is why i wanted to know how w what is the easiest way to have the data
[ 210.00- 229.72] MEE073: when he was talking about like having architecture that things are going to plug into i mean so that things are all modular i mean it would be a good idea if we use that same idea for anything else we are doing or what else we are doing actually even the searches or whatever you know just any sort of thing i mean search results if they are all in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or a list of properties vector you know what
[ 217.00- 218.64] FEO072: ok yeah so
[ 229.96- 232.68] FEO072: ok yeah i see what you mean i think
[ 235.20- 240.00] FEO072: so i i have you already calculated those data what are you supposed to do that
[ 238.92- 240.00] MEE071: yeah i suppose you would be able
[ 240.00- 240.40] FEO072: alright
[ 240.00- 269.60] MEE071: calculator and all stored as objects so dot object files which means that you just re call the n l n object structure and call the load thing and call it that and you can create a list of them or a vector of them and then or just call them one at a time to populate a window but that is what i want to tell you how how what format do you want the data to come back in cause it can come back as w most anything now but what is easiest to display is all sort of
[ 244.88- 245.36] FEO072: alright
[ 247.48- 248.48] MEE073: yeah
[ 250.52- 257.88] MEE073: how do you want to use a blip yeah just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest all the way around right
[ 264.56- 267.40] FEO072: yeah
[ 269.12- 269.72] FEO072: it is a bit for
[ 273.14- 273.48] MEE071: yeah
[ 278.60- 283.96] FEO072: i do not think you can get me i can do it i mean
[ 280.22- 280.80] MEE071: yeah
[ 282.40- 283.20] MEE071: yeah c you c
[ 286.72- 300.00] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah so is i can have it so that it returns you a is at the moment the main data structures are hash table
[ 288.60- 297.06] FEO072: so what we will whenever we open a window for one speaker
[ 299.00- 300.00] MEE073: ok
[ 300.00- 329.96] MEE071: for the meetings that say it has got one that says percent is called percent talk one is percent noise and one is percent participation do you see what i mean so and then has got inside has got a link that has got a has got the speaker is name and then has got their percentage for that thing so can e her come back as a hey you can have the hash table or you can have returned as a vector and will say noise is just a string is noise x percent will say a vector that is co i do not know whatever you can
[ 300.00- 305.00] MEE073: it is time talking to brits
[ 308.52- 310.78] FEO072: yeah i think that is pretty much all the whole
[ 313.36- 315.60] FEO072: yeah ok
[ 321.46- 321.92] FEO072: oh is it
[ 330.00- 343.12] MEE071: can either have it you can either have it you could have it like an embedded a v vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever or what the what the easiest thing to do is have one in this black ok
[ 346.40- 348.36] MEE071: yeah exactly
[ 355.16- 355.48] MEE071: yeah
[ 359.60- 359.96] MEE071: see that is the
[ 360.00- 363.16] MEE071: ok well how do we can i look at that again
[ 361.22- 367.48] FEO072: the one present although we could do we could do the one highlighted as well
[ 365.20- 389.96] MEE071: ok so if it is in that format it is it is speaker it is speaker speaker is the controlling thing not yeah yeah ok yeah yeah yeah so all of this is all that is calculated as well is all the speaker objects yeah that is that is easy so i am quite amusing actually the the influences are i lived in germany for six months do not know if that had any effect to expect too
[ 390.00- 411.64] FEO072: that would that would be implementing what you said that you want to see per topic you want to see which one spoken most something like that so you could you could zap through these topics oh meetings sorry and and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that looks most so do you want to do that then
[ 390.00- 404.28] MEE071: of time talking to brits so then all that is calculated as well we will have to lose to get the dialog out so i do not think that would be difficult
[ 402.24- 410.04] MEE073: so each time are you going straight to the x and l files for for the information or right oh oh ok ok
[ 412.58- 419.98] MEE073: right ok so that is all just pre processed and just pre processed ok
[ 414.32- 419.72] MEE071: so then does this how does is how is this box populated is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted
[ 417.16- 420.00] FEO072: yeah definitely
[ 420.00- 423.46] MEE073: ok ok
[ 421.64- 426.70] FEO072: so yeah random things like just return talking time
[ 422.36- 423.40] MEE071: the one present method
[ 428.68- 430.04] FEO072: yeah ok
[ 429.48- 449.98] MEE071: cause at the moment i am using there is there are methods that say f for the for our using for other talk styles pressing and it says like get get talk time and you and you take the name so that could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that and that would populate that which would be an easy thing to do and the same for the
[ 429.60- 430.44] MEE073: yeah right
[ 431.78- 432.28] FEO072: yeah i mean
[ 436.52- 447.06] MEE073: ok is this is it for the entire corpus or is it just like individual ones like one f one object for one meeting oh each meeting ok
[ 449.20- 449.98] MEE073: wonder if that would be useful
[ 450.00- 450.44] MEE071: ok
[ 450.00- 454.12] MEE073: for some of the other stuff we are doing well i do not know
[ 458.72- 459.10] MEE073: right ok
[ 461.28- 468.28] FEO072: can you put in the what topic we are speaking about as well then i could use that for the for the topic pop up window
[ 462.00- 463.90] MEE071: meetings yeah yeah
[ 465.00- 465.24] MEE073: yeah
[ 468.34- 470.44] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah
[ 468.44- 468.72] MEE073: alright
[ 470.76- 471.12] FEO072: ok
[ 471.98- 479.98] MEE071: yeah ok so i will i will just leave in lots of methods that is that will just return one number at a time that will be the easiest way to do it
[ 475.40- 476.08] FEO072: that was not
[ 476.08- 479.98] MEE073: or just return a null or a blank or blank string
[ 480.00- 482.00] MEE071: ok yeah that is fine
[ 481.44- 481.68] FEO072: yeah
[ 484.32- 484.60] MEE073: no
[ 485.64- 489.48] MEE071: yeah get talk time i think it is called something like that yeah
[ 485.92- 486.16] MEE073: no
[ 486.64- 497.90] FEO072: yeah because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics you have the option of p popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings contained in that topic so
[ 495.72- 510.00] MEE071: no it is stored as an object file it processes a whole lot off line and stores it as an object and then they are much much smaller they are only like a one a file of one k yeah just all pre processed and then it is just each one of the object has got a return a bunch of return methods
[ 508.80- 509.04] FEO072: yeah
[ 509.48- 509.96] MEE073: no no
[ 510.00- 528.78] MEE071: have to re create the object it has got a load method so what you do is you call a nile constructor cause if you call the f proper constructor for each meeting it goes off and does all the processing and stores its own object and then if you call a nile constructor then you pu call load and you can call the load on the other one or all of them or anything like that cause it is a list
[ 510.00- 512.58] MEE073: problem yeah ok ok
[ 510.56- 510.82] FEO072: yeah
[ 513.66- 522.54] FEO072: so how how would you how would you calculate that would you do the summarization as you populate it you know just yeah for the
[ 525.52- 532.12] FEO072: oh right so oh so that that is all sta stored together oh right ok ok
[ 531.28- 531.46] MEE071: yep
[ 533.96- 539.40] MEE071: one object for each meeting yeah although yeah yeah the other
[ 535.68- 539.98] FEO072: sounds good so have you done these yet the yeah
[ 540.00- 542.60] FEO072: just got to decide on what we want to
[ 543.24- 551.44] MEE071: yeah it just tell it tells you who participated at the moment it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time as well
[ 545.28- 555.94] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah so it is all all usable now can i do it tonight
[ 553.92- 555.74] MEE071: yeah yeah that would be pretty easy yeah
[ 555.88- 556.92] MEE073: yeah
[ 559.02- 564.34] MEE071: yeah that would be too difficult but that would be that would cause a problem with anything that was not under data for topics
[ 567.52- 570.00] MEE071: oh yeah well the topic specified you have a default
[ 570.00- 577.26] MEE071: there are some there are some default i do not know exactly a lot of people do not give a great and all the stuff but
[ 576.68- 577.22] FEO072: oh i see
[ 582.24- 587.04] FEO072: well let me know when when it is sort of usable at least
[ 586.82- 587.18] MEE071: yeah
[ 588.62- 599.96] MEE071: ok right yeah that would be a problem and then you can do a search over the meetings over the objects cause that is the thing these these are so small that you can load each wa all of the whole up and do a search over the whole lot to find who part is most useful and what no
[ 591.38- 597.84] FEO072: what do you mean a picture you mean just the yeah but it is not going to take forever i mean it is m yeah
[ 600.00- 603.20] MEE071: problem or what topics were important so it does not crash the thing
[ 609.88- 610.10] FEO072: right
[ 610.28- 615.48] MEE071: what the global statistics come straight off of that do not they cause they are just for the meet the the
[ 612.72- 616.82] FEO072: sounds good so where is that is that stored in the yep
[ 618.24- 622.24] MEE071: the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that stuff
[ 618.98- 621.34] FEO072: on your home directory not in the home directory
[ 623.06- 623.22] FEO072: yep
[ 624.28- 629.98] MEE073: yeah actually i can upload my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your phone just to load
[ 624.68- 625.20] FEO072: it is hopefully
[ 628.56- 630.00] MEE071: no no but i do not think that would be too difficult
[ 630.00- 630.16] MEE071: what
[ 630.00- 635.92] MEE073: this one instead of the the default so that is two lines of code so
[ 631.92- 632.24] FEO072: alright
[ 632.88- 638.08] MEE071: what we want yeah i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
[ 635.14- 643.20] FEO072: yeah well are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you want to do with that if you want to change my code
[ 640.70- 641.64] MEE073: what do you mean
[ 642.78- 654.12] MEE071: no design agree first and the cause if if the problem is if you change the classes it the object serial numbers change and you can not reload the object so all the processing has to be done over again and i have not quite finished a bit so
[ 643.36- 646.98] MEE073: well yeah just the one thing that is like the action for loading up the search thing
[ 645.52- 651.20] FEO072: you yeah but are you do you want to change that m the original embrowser file then or yeah
[ 650.58- 656.92] MEE073: yeah well your version yeah yeah no i did it in my directory just just did it yeah
[ 652.88- 653.92] FEO072: have you done that now or
[ 655.68- 658.32] FEO072: oh just ok so not the actual one but a copy of it
[ 660.00- 672.92] MEE071: you won if i gave you it now and you worked on it and then i changed it and ran the thing again you would never be able to load the objects back up and you would have to and then you would have multiple copies of objects all over the place and you would get silly i think
[ 660.00- 669.30] MEE073: i have a copy yes i am yeah but i will yeah i was going to update that one just cause yeah it just makes sense that things can pass at the right
[ 661.44- 663.04] FEO072: ok yeah no just
[ 666.90- 677.82] FEO072: well just just tell me when because i usually i usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if if the one in the share has changed ok
[ 671.14- 681.00] MEE073: right yeah and then update yeah yeah i have not i have not made any changes to it yet so yeah yeah i will just make that one and let you know
[ 676.36- 688.60] MEE071: but if you can if you want to make the picture if you can do that without anything kind of presumably just the in just that yeah the the that does not take away ok
[ 682.08- 682.84] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 683.12- 690.00] MEE073: cause yeah like i said two lines of code if you want so anyways and then you can play
[ 685.24- 685.52] FEO072: yeah
[ 688.14- 688.40] FEO072: cool
[ 690.00- 696.24] MEE073: there is not much to do you have to get better results like better presented
[ 690.72- 699.24] MEE071: no it will not take very long to get it all finished up yeah but i d i will need to have done one of this stuff too first cause otherwise the objects will not be the same
[ 695.80- 699.92] FEO072: so is that what you are working on now then to to r to present results nice or
[ 698.16- 719.96] MEE073: yeah yeah and just to wire in the the topics and you know we do have a lot of summaries so well also yeah like that that as well so yeah so you just want to find out what kind of objects those were that for the other ones so it goes in and
[ 706.56- 707.92] MEE071: no it is so i am my home direction
[ 707.28- 709.20] FEO072: i mean the h the
[ 710.14- 714.34] MEE071: no i am not happy with it well it is finished up with a glow in the morning we will get a computer
[ 720.00- 723.04] MEE073: i do not know
[ 721.60- 744.08] FEO072: yeah actually for for an end text area whatever it is they they define some hand handy highlights on that so you have got different different highlights you have got just look at the the what they wrote about it they have got like user highlights selection highlights time highlights
[ 733.26- 733.60] MEE073: ok
[ 745.64- 746.48] FEO072: something else
[ 748.66- 749.96] FEO072: so you can quite easily
[ 750.00- 756.16] FEO072: if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something yeah or something like that
[ 755.20- 755.68] MEE073: ok
[ 759.04- 764.16] FEO072: that is the way i did it to highlight to cross highlight between topic and and transcripts
[ 760.60- 760.94] MEE073: ok
[ 765.92- 766.80] MEE073: ok sounds good
[ 766.46- 766.84] FEO072: ok
[ 768.92- 780.00] MEE073: ok there is a few more things to do with that and then now once vanilla gets the the index then that is going to be kind of fun i think i am just wondering if you had to well the way
[ 780.00- 800.02] MEE073: you are doing i was going to ask if the way you were doing it you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you are doing the object so you do not need to just cause if we are if we do have to like if the inverted search says that there is the on time documents are we going to have to load each of these ten corp corp just to do the individual next next t search
[ 803.80- 805.32] MEE073: i think probably
[ 812.40- 814.76] FEO072: maybe
[ 812.58- 813.94] MEE073: it sure is
[ 820.84- 824.84] MEE073: yeah ok alright well i like how it is more like a cool
[ 821.78- 840.00] FEO072: like yeah
[ 827.40- 830.92] MEE073: ok
[ 840.00- 852.40] FEO072: i do not know what i was thinking alright well i have been i have been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterization which is good so i can fill that in now the windows are all there now after lots of feeling
[ 847.96- 849.24] MEE073: ok ok
[ 854.48- 870.00] FEO072: well you know just the pop a pop up one there was difficult enough because it it m basically has to set up like whatever ten pop up windows in memory as in already initialize them because there is there might be ten speakers
[ 860.42- 870.00] MEE071: that way it does not crash if you try and load all ten and one it crashes a little bit it it is a bit dumb if you can ful it if you if you c load up ten different sort of engines so it will take
[ 870.00- 899.98] FEO072: is now all have to have different m windows and and i am working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the other topics of of the meetings that that topic was mentioned in and i have a a question about the we said we wanted a start screen what kind of start screen do we want i mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to
[ 870.00- 889.92] MEE071: usually it can do that fine but it can not do them it can not do them if it thinks they are one cause it is about the amount that each if you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine but if you do not then it like yeah it says ok oh yeah i have got all this space you put in yourself otherwise it goes oh no
[ 870.56- 900.00] MEE073: no
[ 891.88- 893.84] MEE071: it talks to you now does it
[ 895.84- 897.16] MEE071: it is a nice machine i guess
[ 900.00- 911.94] FEO072: the browser or something right yeah it is it is it is animations back sequence
[ 900.00- 902.80] MEE071: oh
[ 901.12- 930.00] MEE073: right
[ 912.76- 914.24] MEE071: oh they are done already ok cool
[ 916.44- 917.52] MEE071: they pop up
[ 919.30- 928.20] FEO072: yeah so do we want yeah maybe we could write an on like the whatever it is called the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser
[ 930.84- 947.32] MEE071: well for just more more words some some speech and some music so some other things oh and there is something too long though we have to you know while we are debugging probably something
[ 933.06- 933.32] MEE073: yeah
[ 936.28- 936.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 939.22- 953.80] FEO072: yeah but how i mean at the moment the way it is it is it is a drop down menu as you see with all the and that because it is it is the dialog class that you use there
[ 944.40- 945.44] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 947.84- 949.48] MEE073: sh
[ 954.60- 960.00] MEE073: yeah i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first but not necessarily i guess if you are doing a search on
[ 958.48- 960.00] MEE071: yeah oh a switchboard
[ 960.00- 967.96] MEE071: that comes up that is just a blank form like that with some buttons on load me a meeting load me a search load me something else whistle a tune
[ 960.00- 962.40] MEE073: the entire you know process
[ 961.44- 971.44] FEO072: yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search and through that once you have got the results you click on something and that one is up
[ 967.64- 968.92] MEE073: yeah that is in that sense
[ 974.88- 977.92] MEE073: right well we can put the logic in it yeah
[ 975.08- 975.52] MEE071: yeah
[ 975.24- 977.28] FEO072: oh does it oh
[ 978.44- 979.88] FEO072: oh just be
[ 982.70- 988.84] MEE073: i could probably even that is should not be too hard to put a check in there and if it has not loaded then force them to load it
[ 984.02- 984.48] FEO072: oh
[ 997.96-1005.38] MEE071: that is on the surface stupid n h t search that would need you to have a meeting loaded before you all start doing any searching talkers
[1000.92-1003.52] FEO072: can you not get this nom object
[1007.76-1012.96] MEE071: you can not the the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you loaded an observation
[1014.84-1015.84] MEE073: set changing
[1018.08-1020.00] FEO072: i suppose we would not want to use yeah
[1019.16-1019.96] MEE071: yeah what we
[1020.00-1028.00] FEO072: we yeah we would not want to use n x t at the beginning anyway because we do not want to search locally we want to touch point so so let us say
[1020.00-1030.60] MEE071: does not that we c you could you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you will not
[1027.56-1030.72] MEE073: unless they know what meeting it is well yeah it is going to
[1030.36-1040.80] FEO072: want to then they would open meeting first right so let us say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
[1032.76-1033.02] MEE073: yeah
[1033.68-1048.88] MEE071: it has to be an observation and even if you go you can go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason the engine there is only one there is only one search method to the search engine the engine class only has one search method
[1045.08-1050.00] MEE073: yeah or well the things i mean just be looking for a word and you know make an if it shows up ten
[1050.00-1059.64] MEE073: in different meetings then at that point they will probably want to like do we want to like if it done by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned and then they have to go through
[1053.36-1053.64] FEO072: yeah
[1054.84-1055.96] MEE071: yeah yeah kind of yeah
[1059.48-1059.76] MEE071: yeah
[1059.80-1062.22] FEO072: yeah but why do we want default i mean just yeah
[1061.86-1064.24] MEE073: well then like to load up like the thing is i think
[1062.76-1063.00] MEE071: yeah
[1065.80-1079.96] MEE073: like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and the whatever the window right now i think just the topic ones although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data so i am just
[1071.16-1071.48] MEE071: yeah
[1080.00-1090.08] MEE073: in if it is kinda like you were saying you have to have a norm object right i mean what do you do a search of all on that side yeah ok yeah that is true
[1087.12-1092.00] FEO072: yeah but local search we can do global search right it is brilliant
[1094.52-1106.54] MEE073: yeah but the ok the global one feeds into the local so if we are getting any useful data it is it is going to be doing a search on each of those files so it is going to be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data in order
[1099.04-1100.68] FEO072: yeah the log
[1104.40-1109.98] FEO072: yeah but yeah the the global inverted false edge and
[1110.00-1113.92] FEO072: gives the non objects basically to the local search i think
[1114.28-1118.84] MEE073: right but it is it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that it requires something
[1117.72-1119.80] FEO072: well yeah that is always going to be the case with search
[1121.32-1124.76] MEE071: it does not get on to load up anyway it can load the dumb one up it does not have any
[1124.24-1139.98] MEE073: yeah well i just thinking of somewhere we could you know s catch the results in in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier but the thing is i mean if we have got that then it is going to be needing really mu really to load the entire corpus for that meeting
[1140.00-1158.36] MEE073: if if it is trying to show us where those were if it is trying to highlight those in the text transcript or whatever then we are going to have to have all that other data in there so each time when we have the search search window and we have like you know ten different meetings you know the word wireless comes up go to meeting one and it has to re log the normal object next one
[1143.72-1144.34] MEE071: it is ok yeah
[1150.28-1153.88] MEE071: yeah but he gives one at a time anyway does not he cause otherwise he would crush the thing
[1160.24-1163.38] MEE073: kitty yeah ok
[1165.36-1169.98] MEE073: it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that is all in but i think it is just for
[1170.00-1184.64] MEE073: ok loading it up it has to try to find a sort of shutdown loading up so so just sort of based on that as well yeah but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
[1185.54-1199.96] FEO072: i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that d if you do a global search first as a first step only return the meetings as in the n not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so you know say you want to
[1189.52-1195.24] MEE071: yeah it is not too slight though i do not think it is not not too bad on that i do not think that will be a too much of a problem
[1196.26-1197.72] MEE073: yeah yeah right
[1198.66-1199.36] MEE071: yeah yeah
[1200.00-1211.32] FEO072: search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language and then you can decide well i want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting or
[1205.12-1205.64] MEE071: yeah
[1206.04-1206.22] MEE073: yeah
[1209.18-1210.06] MEE073: yeah that is true
[1212.16-1213.00] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1215.36-1215.68] MEE073: yeah
[1218.24-1229.98] MEE073: yeah that makes sense and that way they know specifically which meeting it is and i will save the time because i am sure they do not want to have the extra loading time but either they can avoid it so yeah or they can
[1222.68-1223.04] FEO072: yeah
[1228.46-1229.16] FEO072: definitely
[1230.00-1232.00] MEE073: check mark i think it is the ones they want to check so
[1239.86-1248.40] MEE073: well i think they were in the text we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of b d b you know just do a a a straight
[1242.12-1249.20] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return of things when they actually s but when it needs to just to search when it needs to be labeled
[1244.84-1260.00] FEO072: there is yeah in the in in one of the papers they have n names such as better understanding or whatever even one of those even better understanding of
[1250.88-1259.02] MEE073: yeah the long ones yeah like the the working group that it is part of yeah i probably just use the yeah
[1254.00-1254.28] MEE071: yeah
[1257.16-1257.56] MEE071: yeah
[1259.12-1259.32] MEE071: yeah
[1260.00-1265.40] FEO072: something i i love that i love that
[1260.52-1261.28] MEE073: yeah true
[1262.44-1264.72] MEE071: did we think about
[1263.08-1263.94] MEE073: yeah
[1266.80-1268.24] MEE071: better names for the meetings
[1268.16-1269.48] FEO072: yeah yeah
[1270.00-1271.08] MEE073: seems a bit inaccurate
[1271.30-1273.64] FEO072: so i have yeah i have put that in already to
[1275.12-1275.64] FEO072: sure
[1277.96-1283.60] FEO072: so yeah again concretely to the start up start up libraries we can do
[1281.96-1283.52] MEE071: oh do they do they really translate it
[1286.04-1288.76] MEE071: do they ok well that is alright then we will just use ok
[1291.18-1298.52] MEE071: well that is that is a working group is it i want to see the meeting was about vaven better understand it
[1296.86-1297.96] FEO072: well it is true
[1297.12-1300.18] MEE073: do we actually need the the frequencies
[1302.94-1303.14] MEE073: yeah
[1304.32-1305.56] MEE071: ok that is cool that is cool
[1304.80-1306.58] MEE073: oh right that right yeah ok yeah
[1306.54-1310.90] FEO072: yeah how is that i mean do you think you would have have time for that as well
[1311.60-1314.28] MEE073: well thing is if it is being done th or it was
[1316.48-1320.00] MEE073: then the the clash you are trying to get to work on
[1320.00-1341.08] MEE073: friday that did have all that and it was sort of built in and it just had some trouble getting it running properly but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but it the last i heard it was not working so she was going to look at you know more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do but if we need the if we do need the frequencies then
[1320.32-1327.64] MEE071: so who would have the i d f s i mean the d f s the document frequencies for each word
[1330.58-1335.08] MEE071: yeah to do what t skye is talking about you do to do the topic label
[1342.44-1347.90] MEE071: if somebody has done the keywords or the the i d f s or the d f s already would mean not to probably but
[1343.68-1344.68] MEE073: i do not know
[1347.84-1349.98] MEE073: well it would it would have been like a list of
[1348.28-1350.00] FEO072: it w it would have been like a list of
[1350.00-1350.28] FEO072: oh
[1350.00-1350.40] MEE073: or
[1353.88-1354.52] MEE073: what is the sample
[1370.76-1373.04] MEE071: can you do an inverted file search without the t f i d f
[1375.32-1377.08] FEO072: yeah yeah
[1375.68-1380.00] MEE071: i think you need to have that it would have been like a logistical
[1378.82-1379.96] FEO072: so the general score would that be
[1380.00-1389.32] FEO072: be it for the whole of the language or the for the for the whole of the course actually well you know you could try and have some kind of frequencies
[1380.00-1409.20] MEE071: it is the amount that y occur over termed documents basically amount y what is it d f is document frequency is amount that each word occurs no what is it term frequency is amount that that it occurs in a one of m is amount that occurs in each document and o r one is amount that occurs generally so it would be so more it occurs in specific document so compared to its general score better more informative it is about a certain
[1383.52-1391.88] MEE073: corpus yeah well you know you might have some general frequencies yeah
[1391.48-1392.72] FEO072: i see
[1395.72-1405.08] FEO072: so what would the if we had the these fake topics what what would they look like a bunch it is just a list of like keywords or something
[1406.32-1409.98] MEE073: triple s yeah
[1413.04-1440.00] MEE071: the point of the core process is still data yeah
[1416.68-1416.92] MEE073: alright
[1417.80-1436.12] FEO072: ok cause that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it cause if you just have the segmentation that is great but we can not we can not compare it to the to the hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool
[1418.56-1418.84] MEE073: alright
[1425.60-1426.02] MEE073: doing it
[1437.16-1437.36] MEE073: well
[1440.00-1441.88] MEE071: term frequency and based off of frequency
[1444.28-1448.44] MEE071: i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i do not know whether it will work or not but
[1458.48-1460.00] FEO072: yeah that would be really nice
[1460.32-1460.64] MEE071: yeah
[1464.82-1465.12] MEE071: yeah
[1466.60-1470.00] MEE071: yeah but also a key words gives you an own a whole new type of s
[1470.00-1480.48] MEE071: you had to do keyword search but you could do keyword search could be topic search could not it could be the same thing instead of it would just search for keywords and it would not it would not tell them their type of search of the topic is perhaps you could get touch with keywords
[1482.04-1483.16] MEE071: for each which is only
[1483.48-1484.96] FEO072: yeah definitely
[1484.32-1484.64] MEE073: right
[1493.40-1500.00] MEE071: i suppose even calculating the the the the what is it faces themselves
[1494.68-1499.96] MEE073: oh yeah do we need to i mean we are just like oh for you for you stuff i guess
[1495.04-1499.46] FEO072: yeah that is what i am thinking too yeah well we want to we want to
[1500.00-1516.24] MEE071: not going to be too much too long the easy bit is it is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies in in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic cause you do not have to integrate as much more information
[1500.00-1500.80] MEE073: no but that is
[1505.20-1514.24] FEO072: sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed up speed the search up because n x d was over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible they would
[1510.64-1510.92] MEE073: yeah
[1512.84-1513.04] MEE073: yeah
[1517.36-1525.32] FEO072: no but the general inverted file oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that would just be nice extra
[1519.72-1523.60] MEE071: no you can do you can do search without t f i d f you just can not rank the search
[1527.16-1530.00] MEE071: yeah no
[1528.24-1530.00] FEO072: yeah i i was not sure
[1530.00-1536.32] FEO072: totally true true true true sorry what it is only interim
[1530.00-1534.88] MEE071: no but that is what is not that what the idea was in the first place is to rank these rank the results so that
[1530.00-1537.48] MEE073: do not think we had that in the document yeah yeah exactly i know
[1540.00-1540.20] MEE073: yeah
[1542.64-1546.00] MEE071: yeah but that went slow down ranking went slow down
[1543.64-1547.84] MEE073: yeah i mean if you have time so i mean really nice anyway
[1543.68-1559.96] FEO072: yeah i mean if you have time so i would be really nice cause i mean then then it would give you like if you search for a word it would give you the the meetings but also how often the w that word occurred in that meeting that would be so useful yeah yeah exactly
[1550.68-1558.18] MEE071: yeah it still uses an inventifier but it ranks the results by the amount by the height of it yeah i thought that was part of it but yeah ok does not matter if it is not
[1558.20-1560.00] MEE073: yeah yeah exactly
[1560.00-1573.16] MEE073: actually cause the thing is i mean typically but the the thing is we are just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they are looking for a particular term or something they just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and i want to see it yeah
[1562.40-1567.12] MEE071: no we did not
[1562.88-1563.36] FEO072: yeah yeah
[1569.76-1573.74] MEE071: but yeah i guess if you that if that is not part of it do not worry about it
[1572.52-1586.54] FEO072: yeah but it would be useful if you know if you have if if you search for language and you return like you know basically all of the meetings you want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they are just mentioning it at once
[1575.60-1577.82] MEE071: cause i am only going to do this if i have got time anyway
[1577.08-1577.28] MEE073: yeah
[1582.36-1582.64] MEE073: kay
[1585.70-1588.88] MEE073: but if it is like a two word term does a t f i d f
[1586.84-1590.00] MEE071: we would just give you a rank it would that was the whole point was to
[1589.64-1589.72] MEE073: m
[1590.00-1592.82] MEE071: i was going to say this is your top one this is your bottom
[1590.00-1608.44] MEE073: well like it is not a compound noun it is just two words together in i do not know i do not know just something like edinburgh university yeah well it is it is actually a hit bar sunny day yeah
[1600.68-1601.42] FEO072: language and
[1602.34-1607.46] MEE071: yeah but it but it is how how informative is that t f i d f is an informative score is not it
[1606.08-1610.04] FEO072: i have got edinburgh and language yeah ok
[1619.44-1620.00] MEE073: but it is not maybe
[1619.60-1620.00] MEE071: that is a
[1620.00-1622.30] MEE071: treat your compound nouns
[1620.00-1642.38] MEE073: it more complicated because the thing is thing is that way we were d we were just looking for words period each word in in index well that is way we were thinking about it and n n it is just saying were se two words in in any of se documents and n if was n we would go closer and do next research to look for exact term or regular expression or whatever
[1621.04-1625.48] FEO072: yeah
[1624.30-1625.24] MEE071: well like what
[1633.08-1641.08] MEE071: that is a compound noun
[1643.04-1650.00] MEE071: in its most simple form it would do separate rank for each one each turn you could make it more complicated and make it difficult
[1650.00-1651.64] MEE071: but they
[1654.08-1657.00] MEE071: yeah you can just have em up or
[1660.40-1662.80] MEE071: yeah yeah you do not wear that sort of thing
[1668.46-1669.76] MEE071: yeah
[1668.56-1672.44] MEE073: yeah or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that so
[1672.24-1680.00] MEE071: i guess you just do some of the of the the individual t f i d f for each term returned
[1676.16-1680.00] MEE073: like i am just wondering if it is going to give us something cool then you know absolutely but if it is
[1680.00-1687.74] MEE071: and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score and the higher the more the more informative each term is for each thing it will give you a
[1680.00-1686.36] MEE073: sort of like if the n x t search is still got to be run to find these terms or these you know these patterns or whatever
[1689.56-1692.28] MEE071: be of your high thing it is pretty crude anyway it is just looking for
[1689.56-1703.56] MEE073: or also like do wild cards work for something like that so if you are looking for wireless wired wire blah blah blah you can do wire with a star and no actually that is a problem for me too so or you know
[1694.12-1705.86] MEE071: i think it is all it is going to do is look for se separate oh cause then it is going to go into the n x t search and determine names and it is yeah yeah yeah that is true so yeah that is less creepy but
[1706.82-1708.44] MEE073: yeah
[1713.28-1716.52] MEE073: it should it should work yeah i am just yeah i am just excited about
[1714.88-1720.52] MEE071: groups of terms yeah without doing any like word pairs or something like that
[1720.36-1720.56] MEE073: yeah
[1722.88-1739.98] FEO072: so to come back to the start up screen i am i am i am i am very unsure about what that should look like i mean we want to for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting what kind of information do you want to have about the meeting i mean the the the longer name actually
[1724.52-1726.46] MEE073: hi ok yeah
[1728.52-1739.96] MEE071: yeah then they that works yeah that is yeah but the idea is that gives you an informality score how you combine
[1728.80-1733.42] MEE073: yeah i have got you know somewhere p d f
[1737.28-1740.00] MEE073: yeah well it was yeah do the p d f switch it to polar screen
[1740.00-1751.46] FEO072: if there is one cause they do not all have one in it what the users that spoke uses that to a power then that is probably pretty much the same for the same group
[1740.00-1760.58] MEE071: right that is gives up to you i guess there is lots in there let us try if if you were it is there is a lo whole load about it in manning and schud they have got a whole chunk about it is all just i r is not it it is basic information between them they have got a big a good chapter on it if you have not got it it is uncognitive
[1740.00-1741.28] MEE073: i have sort of acti p d up
[1745.80-1748.94] MEE073: ok is that ok ok
[1750.84-1752.20] MEE073: ok
[1754.64-1755.22] FEO072: yeah i like that
[1755.22-1758.20] MEE073: oh ok
[1758.72-1764.44] FEO072: yeah just to give them an idea a general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to a a group
[1764.20-1768.78] MEE071: yeah me too hundreds of figures
[1770.24-1771.36] MEE073: yeah
[1777.64-1779.24] MEE073: yeah potentially yeah
[1780.44-1780.68] FEO072: yeah
[1782.16-1793.58] FEO072: yeah well yeah i want to look at the meeting where someone sort of spoke of that you know s some sort of research group i want that first meeting look at that
[1782.56-1787.96] MEE073: for bra for the most part i mean there will be a set of people that do a subset of things you need probably
[1785.60-1787.52] MEE071: ok
[1794.06-1800.00] MEE073: search for stuff or f start working i dunno for the for the for the for the for the browse ok like search
[1800.00-1801.48] MEE073: browse
[1803.48-1814.20] MEE073: like if you are looking for something speci like is that what you are thinking like if they if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to you know that meeting on december third and they just want to go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and browse that ok
[1805.04-1806.24] FEO072: oh oh
[1816.28-1819.36] MEE071: do you want to go on the start up screen yeah
[1816.82-1817.08] MEE073: yeah
[1817.60-1829.98] FEO072: i do not think we need that yeah because we we just want to have a way of of you know because as soon as they have got loaded their first meeting they can they can browse through that
[1821.72-1821.90] MEE073: right
[1823.84-1824.08] MEE073: yeah
[1826.88-1828.76] MEE071: yeah i guess i yeah i guess that is you know
[1828.06-1829.98] MEE073: yeah browse
[1830.00-1830.68] FEO072: quite nicely
[1830.00-1849.24] MEE073: by meeting browse by law browse by speaker like d no i am just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top like if they are looking for a particular person particular working group particular whatever and we just we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want or we could keep it more general yeah
[1838.34-1838.64] FEO072: yeah
[1847.08-1847.60] FEO072: what do you mean
[1853.78-1855.08] FEO072: well how how are we going to know that
[1857.60-1859.82] FEO072: oh have you seen one
[1861.76-1874.80] MEE073: yeah but i am just thinking like initially when they load up what are the range of things that they would want to do like if they are part of x working group they want to get in there do we want to save preferences
[1864.16-1889.40] FEO072: but that would defy the whole point of browsing right if you only wanted to look at it and find it and do the browsing well you just you just scroll down the list and find your favorite one i mean it is not like they come back every day and do the same browsing that is who was chosen
[1877.86-1883.84] MEE073: well if they are part of b d b working group they are going to want to look at the b d b ones and so we will default to that i do not know
[1886.10-1889.98] MEE073: based on what they did the last time
[1888.80-1890.00] MEE071: it can have a side profile
[1890.00-1892.84] MEE071: presentation could have a save present for references i guess
[1890.00-1890.86] MEE073: it says yeah
[1893.16-1893.40] MEE073: yeah
[1895.12-1895.64] FEO072: yeah
[1896.88-1920.00] MEE073: if you only want to look at it and find it yeah
[1897.96-1904.48] MEE071: well alright call it favorites then you could have a favorite
[1907.24-1911.04] MEE071: yeah cause why not information is in general
[1917.20-1918.68] FEO072: oh right oh ok
[1920.36-1949.98] MEE073: ok well no i am just getting back to the sort of what could be on the the start up screen like there is just a range of things we could do we could have like search options browse options and we just i dunno just playing around with ideas and then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting then do this blah blah blah so we can yeah sort of you know guide them and just
[1920.48-1920.80] FEO072: well
[1922.88-1927.84] FEO072: yeah no
[1930.24-1938.62] FEO072: i i was not going to put any you know any any help in the any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest just the controls
[1950.00-1957.36] MEE073: like hey my task is to do this and there is a button for it perfect you know you know
[1950.20-1951.40] FEO072: i see
[1955.04-1956.24] MEE071: yeah
[1956.16-1959.36] FEO072: but i mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting right
[1958.04-1959.56] MEE071: yeah it would be quite good if it has yeah
[1961.52-1964.20] FEO072: yeah well so it is yeah so then so it is both of those tags
[1966.82-1979.98] MEE073: no no that is not what i am suggesting what i am just saying like these are just like a lot of programs well kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first just cause they do not want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly
[1967.20-1970.04] MEE071: just a button alright search buttons such as
[1978.20-1980.00] FEO072: yeah that all happens to the same
[1980.00-1990.16] FEO072: searcher basically either the user what knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it or he does not and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
[1980.00-1986.24] MEE073: use tasks or just exit and just let me use the program you know as well
[1984.56-1986.56] MEE071: yeah
[1989.92-1992.36] MEE073: probably or search something yeah
[1990.96-2008.44] MEE071: well search yeah yeah so if even if it just had two things just said one is the one said take me straight to this meeting and have a text box you can enter it or drop down menu and then another one that said search that led you instantly plug up your search like a yeah yeah yeah or one that yeah or one
[1998.68-1999.28] FEO072: yeah
[2002.26-2007.04] MEE073: yep like a find specific meeting that is an easy sort of thing
[2010.94-2011.18] MEE071: yeah
[2012.64-2015.52] FEO072: oh i see what you mean inside the segment yeah
[2018.72-2020.76] MEE073: sort of like a slide scratcher
[2019.60-2027.98] MEE071: well so just well the other thing to do is just have the search as the default just it opens and the search window opens and that is the interface and you just go from there
[2031.24-2038.92] MEE071: and then that brings up the browser after you have searched for something or well the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu
[2033.28-2034.68] FEO072: yeah that is that is what yep
[2039.16-2039.98] FEO072: yeah
[2040.00-2056.44] FEO072: yeah that looks about right but i am i am unsure about how to how to put all the information in there cause we need the long term menu but we want all the information about the name the longer term and the users how do i
[2040.00-2065.42] MEE071: that says just and a go button that said take me to this so the so the yeah so the f only thing that comes up when you finish is a when you start it is just one window like that and it has got all the search stuff right down there so this is your search it is just all here and here is just go to wherever and a go button and then from there it takes you to wherever version you go yeah
[2058.62-2065.70] FEO072: no actually codes i mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in other to in other corpus copy
[2067.04-2069.98] MEE071: and at the top it says welcome to welcome to well
[2069.68-2069.98] FEO072: yeah
[2070.00-2072.28] FEO072: just drop down to the not
[2070.00-2070.48] MEE071: browse
[2078.14-2079.64] MEE071: drop drop down there
[2080.84-2084.58] FEO072: yep yep yep but then yeah as i said i had to do it
[2083.44-2086.56] MEE071: you want i yeah
[2085.76-2090.72] MEE073: well we do not do we do not have user names do we do not have all these codes let us say maybe eleven or whatever yeah
[2086.24-2086.68] FEO072: yeah
[2088.30-2089.44] MEE071: yeah we will see how many you get
[2092.62-2093.00] MEE073: yeah
[2094.38-2095.16] MEE071: yeah that is two
[2095.20-2097.88] MEE073: in a case like that we do want fructile we do not want them to type into it
[2095.30-2100.00] FEO072: no no no i am not i am not saying you can you can pick a user but it should come
[2100.00-2113.44] FEO072: come up with some list but an extended list of the of the meeting so you know you have a b d r whatever it was called oh one and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants
[2100.80-2101.30] MEE071: yeah
[2101.80-2108.80] MEE073: ok and allow multiple no ok you are just looking for one specific to get all the specific
[2107.32-2126.20] MEE071: this is a good one do you want to search your search if you want to look for one meeting and just look at it that is fine ok that is that is true that is oh yes you have two one one is one one there well you got two one for meeting one for speaker and you can choose you can go go for go or go for the other go and go for both and go for both and search
[2111.40-2111.76] MEE073: ok
[2112.50-2112.78] MEE073: ok
[2118.02-2129.96] FEO072: i was thinking that yeah but then yeah no it is not at all i think at all tip yeah i have not tried that yet but i just i was going to do it but it is yeah
[2120.52-2121.46] MEE073: no trust me
[2130.00-2160.00] FEO072: yeah i am not sure what the is that very is that not annoying if you have to hold it
[2143.70-2150.52] MEE071: we could do microsoft style and hold it over and it it pops up a thing
[2146.88-2151.00] MEE073: no
[2152.02-2153.02] MEE071: is that complicated
[2154.92-2156.16] MEE073: a tool tip
[2158.84-2159.98] MEE071: mouse over is it nicole san
[2160.00-2162.60] MEE071: you actually listen well let us do that then
[2168.32-2174.08] MEE071: you get out of the bloody way i am trying to switch to that bit
[2178.18-2189.98] FEO072: yeah it would just be nice to have some basic information on it yeah i am thinking that that updates depending on yeah maybe that is the best idea then so you have got
[2180.72-2182.76] MEE073: yeah that is a good idea
[2180.76-2189.98] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah that is that is in the way but that is why you could just have a list of your users then and just you just say i want to look for this user great
[2190.00-2194.88] FEO072: drop down menu a search a search button not search a go button
[2190.00-2205.96] MEE071: fine me then it then it pulls up a list of all the ones we have got there user and then you search then but then you are doing search maybe just leave it just have them leading names there and do not worry about the speakers if they are doing speakers they are doing search it is not the same as doing a quick access
[2197.12-2197.76] FEO072: and then
[2200.00-2203.64] FEO072: some sort of fields which updates stand out actually depending on what you have highlighted
[2204.40-2204.68] MEE073: yeah
[2206.36-2208.00] FEO072: yeah yeah that sounds good
[2211.16-2218.20] MEE071: yeah or you could have a text box there that has got yeah as you go over the then that does not get in your sleep in the morning
[2215.50-2219.54] MEE073: yeah depending on yeah
[2216.32-2216.68] FEO072: i think
[2218.80-2219.96] FEO072: non
[2220.00-2224.96] FEO072: yeah what does non actually sound for
[2226.96-2229.32] FEO072: no oh yeah
[2233.88-2236.18] MEE071: yeah the full name and then speakers
[2238.12-2243.58] FEO072: oh you have got lots of non something and then night looking and then n something
[2238.44-2242.84] MEE071: yeah we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up the
[2244.64-2245.04] MEE071: i think
[2247.24-2250.00] MEE071: oh cool and a a thing a meeting and on
[2247.58-2249.82] FEO072: oh really oh yeah
[2250.00-2252.64] MEE071: yeah
[2250.24-2251.64] MEE073: yeah
[2255.38-2259.56] MEE071: think it is a knight object model or what is it i think
[2256.08-2264.42] MEE073: just yeah just but it is i think in that case it is the right corpus or something it is the right corpus or something yeah
[2258.92-2271.58] FEO072: no and most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you have got to update this jonathan this is this is un unintelligible right i know what you mean
[2261.74-2270.68] MEE071: knight right yeah it is your right it is the right corpus yeah it is the knight right corpus and then you got knight right element and then you got knight right actually it is oh
[2267.96-2269.22] MEE073: yeah
[2271.92-2274.86] MEE073: yeah
[2273.62-2280.00] MEE071: yeah i think the n ones are interfaces and the knight one one of the ways around one is an interface and one is actually an implemented clock
[2279.16-2280.00] FEO072: yeah
[2279.32-2280.00] MEE073: yeah
[2280.00-2281.24] FEO072: yeah
[2280.00-2291.00] MEE071: s cause if you go back enough i think the what is this name that we can the a p i is alright but there is not a lot of description in it it is it is very clear
[2280.00-2281.00] MEE073: ok
[2283.96-2296.20] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah no definitely not definitely right so anyone else got anything to say
[2287.84-2288.24] MEE073: yeah
[2293.74-2309.98] MEE071: yeah yeah so you end up just a set it returns a n text box ok what is that though it is a implementation of an n text
[2298.36-2301.12] MEE073: right right
[2301.20-2305.80] FEO072: do we yeah do we want another meeting at the end of the week with pen and l
[2306.64-2306.92] MEE073: yeah
[2308.60-2309.98] FEO072: yeah yeah
[2309.52-2309.98] MEE073: yeah
[2310.00-2316.12] FEO072: yeah i mean it i think i am going to do quite a bit of work this week so i will have probably more to talk about
[2310.00-2321.98] MEE071: it interface what is that oh it is a extended version of it oh it is not it
[2310.00-2310.52] MEE073: yeah
[2316.40-2319.78] MEE073: yeah that is a bit crazy
[2318.18-2318.98] FEO072: i think
[2323.36-2323.88] MEE073: yeah
[2323.40-2323.64] FEO072: but
[2326.60-2329.20] MEE073: well not really just going to keep on going

[2364.60-2366.28] FEO072: what the
[2365.88-2366.78] MEE073: ok yeah sure
[2369.16-2369.82] MEE073: oh
[2371.76-2373.62] MEE071: n just off the s p t
[2373.96-2385.96] MEE073: possibly i do not know usually by then so need a break although well i do not know cause it is the lab and try and get some work done for the the learning stuff
[2379.74-2381.44] MEE071: yeah yeah but i mean just right after
[2384.20-2385.44] FEO072: yeah how about
[2384.60-2387.44] MEE071: yeah for that yeah that could be fine yeah
[2387.52-2387.82] MEE073: yeah
[2390.60-2392.98] MEE073: ok
[2390.68-2391.06] FEO072: ok
[2391.36-2392.60] MEE071: right
[2394.92-2395.24] MEE071: fri
[2395.72-2399.98] FEO072: i am yeah no no that that would only give us like
[2397.48-2400.00] MEE073: work three o clock or you
[2399.40-2399.96] MEE071: right
[2400.00-2407.52] FEO072: fifty five minutes or something well what well quite late like you know five or six
[2400.00-2404.38] MEE073: want to get out ok
[2401.48-2405.44] MEE071: i do not know maybe i think i am not sure what i am doing so again
[2407.68-2415.42] MEE073: cause i think she has got a class at eleven we have all got cla well three of us have a class at twelve
[2411.16-2412.80] FEO072: well three o clock let us say three o clock
[2414.52-2418.14] MEE071: i do not know so we save for a clock and then if there is a serious problem i will tell you
[2417.76-2429.22] MEE073: or if we could try one we could try shortly after well yeah well yeah well it would not be a long meeting then would you want to no probably not if one is bad for you then you do not want to
[2421.56-2421.96] FEO072: ok
[2424.14-2428.72] FEO072: right i will write i will write this meeting up and i will send it to anyone else as well
[2431.44-2448.28] FEO072: no because she is not here i collect meeting subjects yeah no we should probably do that in the next panel
[2432.36-2432.78] MEE073: ok
[2434.38-2436.24] MEE071: smile on me i do not think we need it
[2437.92-2439.04] MEE071: three is better than five or six
[2438.56-2439.32] MEE073: yeah yeah
[2442.28-2453.44] MEE071: three let us say three o clock and then if there is a problem with that then if three o clock is a problem five or six will be a problem that is not what i would be here but i do not think that will be i am not sure
[2450.20-2460.00] FEO072: so can we just can we just re repeat briefly what we have spoken about so we have then done a progress on the speaker characterization who does the speaker character
[2458.88-2459.96] MEE073: ok
[2460.00-2474.88] FEO072: provision we have mentioned topic labeling with keywords we discussed if the search should be ranked and michael did you have anything else
[2460.00-2476.52] MEE071: collecting them are you just saying it to her so no i mean is she collecting oh right oh yeah sorry yeah it is cool for the gifting i thought somebody was collecting them but well that is what i thought when you said that
[2478.48-2478.76] MEE073: yeah
[2478.98-2482.62] MEE071: then we would know who has missed them or who has gone as it is
[2480.88-2481.20] MEE073: ok
[2484.72-2485.40] FEO072: ok
[2488.48-2489.92] FEO072: oh well basically
[2490.00-2495.46] FEO072: not not unless you have got time for it at the end or be nice at the end
[2504.72-2519.94] MEE073: there is just sort of a basic implementation stuff that i was wondering about but no it should be fine no it is just a good question did we decide whether it should be ranked no for now
[2515.46-2520.00] FEO072: i think it would yeah i think i think it would be
[2518.00-2518.48] MEE071: yeah
[2520.00-2522.36] FEO072: would it would give you the most relevant result
[2523.98-2545.26] MEE073: yeah well i i kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it is not it is not really getting them together like if someone is looking for a particular term i do not know just just do not know if it would bring us that much
[2538.28-2550.00] FEO072: no but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as a you know some some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use
[2546.68-2547.08] MEE073: how so
[2550.00-2563.80] FEO072: that word like in every sentence and then you have got those that just mention you know mention it briefly like once or twice saying you know my language is german or something stupid but you do not really want so you want to distinguish those somehow or pronounce anyway
[2550.92-2568.12] MEE073: if if if they are looking for like i say sunny day and you know sunny shows up in this document date shows up but they are not together or if they are two i do not it just does not you are looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
[2566.96-2567.92] FEO072: yeah yeah
[2573.24-2576.70] FEO072: i i for a lot of terms we can just do something really simple i mean
[2582.36-2582.58] MEE073: yeah
[2589.36-2589.52] MEE073: right
[2594.26-2604.20] MEE071: yeah that would help but not for that for single terms it would be very useful for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
[2594.62-2598.14] MEE073: yeah
[2596.44-2596.84] FEO072: yeah
[2600.28-2609.98] FEO072: yeah just just just just disregard yeah i mean you you just do it really simply you know you will have the results at the end of the call
[2603.20-2607.88] MEE073: well in all terms we can just do something much simpler i mean
[2607.24-2609.98] MEE071: yeah or you could do it and override it by the
[2610.00-2613.32] FEO072: s because yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2610.00-2619.76] MEE071: you c you could just ignore the ranking if it does not show up together or you could have you could penalize it you could just put a play on it
[2615.60-2615.88] MEE073: yeah
[2617.60-2640.00] MEE073: well but you still have to do the searches still have to do the n x t search then right if it does not show up yeah
[2620.24-2622.16] FEO072: it does not have to be all intelligent
[2622.08-2629.04] MEE071: yeah you do the n s t e show so it does not show up together either disregard it or put a weighting against it so if you c how many pairs you get
[2625.04-2625.84] FEO072: yeah that is true
[2631.32-2633.72] MEE071: yeah so then just yeah
[2640.00-2640.98] MEE071: excellent yeah
[2640.00-2649.12] MEE073: cause c l g is doing this good we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but no i am just actually yeah
[2652.48-2655.56] MEE073: yeah plus or minus yeah that is true
[2652.86-2660.06] MEE071: cause some things you are going to get a lot of results off and if the one that you got just happens to be at the bottom and it was actually the most relevant one something like that was off
[2658.78-2670.00] MEE073: well thing is also i mean if it is well yeah yeah ok search and exit i think we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that would get returned if there were fifteen meetings like
[2661.44-2668.20] FEO072: well it is not that many meetings yeah but there are seventy five yeah is that really wow
[2670.00-2676.24] MEE073: which is in then it is going to show you those and rank them as to which is the highest ok i see that
[2672.84-2690.76] MEE071: yeah and also with there is something like sunny day the if sunny and day are not mentioned together a lot but sunny type expressions once that its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them if you just d add them together
[2681.52-2682.56] FEO072: yeah that is true
[2686.12-2695.42] FEO072: it would be useful as well for a word like a language that might occur in all of them but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow
[2689.56-2699.96] MEE073: well the thing is i mean that will be exactly how we are doing it now like we are just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document if they do then there is a possibility that they occur together and then we do yeah
[2699.34-2699.98] FEO072: you know you still
[2700.00-2702.06] FEO072: want to be able to search for for the word language
[2700.00-2701.12] MEE073: access written on that document
[2701.24-2717.98] MEE071: yeah yeah but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something is an amazing highly ranked thing from the t f i d f it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the i can assume you only have a you have a do you sh you return all results for all say you type language and it returns seventy five meetings
[2703.18-2703.72] MEE073: yeah yeah
[2704.10-2704.98] FEO072: in a sense of order
[2708.48-2710.24] FEO072: we will discuss it again on friday
[2718.20-2727.72] MEE073: well right now it is not doing anything so i do not i do not know what what it is doing but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2723.24-2726.76] MEE071: yeah there are only seventy f but there are seventy five meetings yeah yeah
[2726.36-2728.80] FEO072: yep yep
[2729.20-2729.40] MEE073: yeah
[2730.00-2741.90] MEE071: so if it so yeah if you return seventy five wh where do you stop or how do you rank them or something or if it turns twenty even if it turns twenty do you cut it off at ten do you rank them do you what is the threshold or anything like that but
[2735.76-2739.86] MEE073: yeah yeah that is true ok
[2742.24-2747.52] MEE073: yeah we could do them all
[2744.40-2746.62] MEE071: looks like the memorial whatever the title is
[2756.78-2757.02] MEE073: yeah
[2776.76-2777.20] MEE071: yeah
[2784.88-2785.36] MEE071: so is that it
[2786.28-2787.08] MEE073: yeah
[2787.32-2789.98] MEE071: done tick
[2790.00-2792.02] MEE071: ok i have timed off already
[2790.20-2790.56] MEE073: ok
[2792.20-2792.90] MEE073: yeah
[2799.08-2799.64] MEE073: ok

[ 164.80- 171.20] FEO070: it is like project school

[ 173.80- 179.16] MEE071: yeah
[ 175.44- 179.98] MEE073: it is just it seems a little chaos i do not know what this is it is
[ 178.30- 178.88] FEO072: yeah
[ 180.00- 193.66] MEE073: i know it is it is like if you are going to use this stuff later on in your life then you t spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it is like what is the minimum i can get about it it will get me what we need so it is like i do not know unless i want to do something with this in the future
[ 185.92- 187.00] FEO070: yeah
[ 187.00- 191.52] FEO072: yeah
[ 187.48- 190.80] MEE071: yeah
[ 194.96- 196.02] MEE071: things i like
[ 195.08- 196.70] FEO072: does it have a project for this or
[ 196.24- 202.96] MEE073: yeah i do not know anyway so yeah let us put that
[ 203.08- 206.76] FEO072: there is a file in the directory called disfo
[ 208.64- 209.52] FEO072: i hope what is it
[ 209.36- 209.62] MEE073: i
[ 209.68- 209.98] MEE071: is it
[ 210.00- 213.08] MEE071: excel ex ex dot excel file
[ 211.04- 223.82] MEE073: i think i yeah i i saw that and i am just trying to remember if i did create it cause i think i was cause i was trying some stuff a couple weeks ago so that may be mine
[ 219.94- 224.50] FEO070: yeah
[ 224.08- 232.72] MEE071: does not have anything in it i have a big thing in it but it does it has about three lines of x m l that do not do much of a thing what is that
[ 225.48- 226.40] MEE073: oh really ok
[ 228.10- 230.08] FEO072: ok yeah that is right yeah
[ 228.62- 238.56] MEE073: ok ok ok yeah i saw it again today i was just like yeah i think that was me i think so but yeah yeah that was that was yeah sure
[ 233.80- 235.00] FEO072: oh right
[ 236.20- 239.98] FEO072: do you remember that just you just thought i was
[ 238.82- 239.98] FEO070: yeah
[ 240.00- 244.88] FEO070: should have run the i l l that is why it is so
[ 240.00- 240.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 240.58- 244.20] MEE071: it just seems to be the occupied space so it does not matter which place i am in
[ 244.04- 247.14] MEE073: giving false impressions of what is happening something is going on
[ 245.98- 266.54] MEE071: yeah i had lots of stuff in there yesterday lots of stuff i know they live there but there is i had even more stuff there yesterday i was unzipping all these kinda crazy huge things that were in the box i needed them they were for this though it is alright about that
[ 248.78- 253.32] MEE073: yeah i know i see
[ 250.12- 252.36] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 252.36- 253.14] FEO072: all those objects
[ 253.16- 256.60] FEO072: i know they live there but there is i had even more stuff there yeah so
[ 261.14- 269.98] MEE073: i do not know i was recording on that once what do you actually do how much we have ok so we probably will not have to worry about that
[ 264.20- 268.60] FEO072: what did actually do a whole twig out ok so we probably want to
[ 270.00- 274.38] MEE073: should run yeah i know that is right yeah
[ 270.76- 279.80] MEE071: yeah yeah it is about yeah it says i think it is about eight gigs on there so yeah it is just much bigger than all of our home libraries so
[ 273.66- 274.88] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 276.76- 279.02] MEE073: yeah that is right
[ 280.24- 282.36] MEE073: yeah how is everything else going
[ 282.44- 284.56] FEO072: has anyone had time to to play with it
[ 285.08- 292.68] MEE071: yeah i had a play of it yes i had no it was good really yeah i liked it
[ 288.40- 289.14] FEO072: and comments
[ 296.00- 299.98] MEE071: it generated a lot of exceptions in the background
[ 299.04- 300.00] MEE073: oh yeah
[ 300.00- 302.50] FEO072: oh right
[ 300.00- 301.96] MEE071: but that did not cause any problems but it just
[ 300.00- 300.12] MEE073: so
[ 301.88- 313.28] MEE073: do we want to keep that like are we keeping that how that happens it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like as it does everything it just kind of i guess that is it is default behavior on it so it is just kind of it does not really do anything so ok
[ 305.88- 308.40] FEO070: it is good ok
[ 310.12- 326.92] FEO072: might as well yeah i mean yeah the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago there is still this one error which is a bug in in n x t and that r always generates these i think when you when you left click or right click or something i can not remember now
[ 320.20- 320.78] MEE073: oh right
[ 326.42- 327.84] FEO070: ok
[ 327.40- 327.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 330.00- 338.20] FEO072: if it is a real error then it it stops so you can not make any any any good good good good
[ 332.80- 347.82] MEE071: yeah i did not discover any of those yeah but i did have a look i fronted it to see if it would break but it did not break too i did not play that long but it seemed alright really yeah and the the the start up screen looks quite good looks alright
[ 335.52- 338.76] MEE073: yeah
[ 344.00- 344.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 347.04- 347.30] FEO072: yeah
[ 347.78- 357.16] MEE073: yeah i was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what i was doing so i did not did not take it for a full test run yet but you can do that it is quite right after this
[ 352.20- 352.54] FEO072: ok
[ 355.56- 360.00] FEO072: yeah that would be good is there any any comments you have about just like wording
[ 360.00- 362.28] FEO072: in or some sort of minor things
[ 362.92- 371.12] MEE071: no it looks alright the only the only thing is the it is not the start up screen is not too pretty but that is not the problem
[ 365.44- 369.40] FEO070: yeah
[ 369.32- 382.48] FEO072: yeah at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all but you know i would make them a bit nicer if i had more time but at the moment it does not look like that so i will
[ 369.48- 371.16] MEE073: yeah
[ 380.20- 383.52] MEE071: no it is not it is not it is not the on the top of it
[ 381.84- 388.00] MEE073: if you if you change your window manager it might look a little bit nicer oh yeah i am kidding
[ 385.28- 390.00] MEE071: yeah i think it would look better on windows as well actually cause java uses the native windows
[ 390.00- 390.64] MEE071: does not it say
[ 391.80- 392.12] MEE071: yeah
[ 392.80- 397.78] MEE073: yeah actually can we run it on windows
[ 393.44- 394.12] MEE071: oh you do not
[ 395.20- 397.84] MEE071: oh
[ 397.16- 402.60] FEO072: but that took me so long to give this bloody start went they it was so nasty
[ 401.00- 401.88] MEE071: to the user
[ 401.20- 402.56] MEE073: yeah
[ 405.88- 408.78] MEE073: were you using like a gooey builder or just all from the pod
[ 408.20- 409.68] FEO072: no this is just yeah
[ 410.16- 410.92] MEE073: ok and that is
[ 413.08- 414.92] MEE073: that is nasty
[ 414.80- 418.96] MEE071: well the the speech characterization is finished
[ 418.92- 420.00] MEE073: right
[ 419.86- 420.00] FEO072: what
[ 420.00- 420.20] FEO072: right
[ 420.00- 420.64] MEE073: right
[ 420.28- 431.26] MEE071: i have not done it i have not updated all those object files yet though cause it takes ages on these computers i do not it is faster for some bizarre reason if i log in at home and then run the code it runs it much faster than if i do it here
[ 431.12- 432.80] FEO072: that is it is called here
[ 432.76- 436.38] MEE071: but it does it does not have to sit in the lab and wait half an hour or whatever it takes
[ 434.48- 438.36] MEE073: well can you connect to your whole machine from here and then start it from there
[ 438.76- 449.98] MEE071: no it is right there it really speed it up
[ 439.04- 447.12] FEO072: i have done some like couple of words to explain it
[ 442.36- 445.56] MEE073: i have done some like couple of times since then
[ 447.12- 449.98] FEO072: try that filter
[ 450.00- 459.24] FEO072: yeah i started i started using your the the speak i do not know if you have seen that in yeah
[ 450.00- 453.96] MEE071: yeah
[ 453.68- 453.90] FEO070: ok
[ 458.40- 467.14] MEE071: i saw that i saw that it it does it tells tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah something like that
[ 466.94- 472.76] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah but it is good your your sounds is really good it has got a good interface and easy to use it is nice
[ 467.68- 468.64] FEO070: yeah
[ 473.24- 480.00] MEE071: yeah the the the dialog acts are all done and they are quite amusing some of them but there are some of them some
[ 480.00- 501.20] MEE071: i mean the the thing actually what i wanted to talk about dialog backs was there are some that occur all the time that i just and i do not know how interesting there are so the fir one statement is that it will b i have removed it cause it was like everything is prefixed by statement every single dialog back starts with statement and so everybody is top dialog back statement so
[ 496.80- 497.02] FEO072: right
[ 500.88- 503.68] FEO072: well we will do it when we include that then
[ 502.44- 509.52] MEE071: so i got rid of that and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel well i do not know what that means who knows what was it back channel
[ 510.00- 511.84] FEO072: is it yeah
[ 512.10- 515.76] MEE071: is that what that means oh we will keep that then and then the other sec well
[ 512.60- 512.76] FEO072: yeah
[ 515.20- 518.68] FEO072: i do not know is that is very reasonable because everyone is it it is very
[ 515.60- 517.84] MEE073: well it is kind of boring is not it
[ 518.64- 535.72] MEE071: yeah some people do not know there are some people who do not do that actually yeah you can see that they do not do that and it is the bottom of their list yeah and some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions what else comes up
[ 520.80- 521.16] FEO072: really
[ 523.92- 527.32] FEO072: they are asleep i think
[ 535.28- 540.00] FEO072: so which you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to like
[ 540.68- 569.96] MEE071: yeah well that is the thing that is why i wanted to know whether or not we cause at the moment you can get there is a method that will just give you the top five for or the top x you give it a number it will give you the top whatever for each person and then each meeting knows about all the different dialog acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred and we will give you that in top order as well or we will give you or you can just search for each specific dialog act but you have to search on in b s and k s or
[ 547.60- 557.82] MEE073: or i dunno if we have like a a choice so they can filter those out the the top most common just say ok well show all or show you know only in in each of the seven else
[ 559.88- 560.16] MEE073: yeah
[ 560.20- 560.46] FEO072: but
[ 561.48- 566.80] FEO072: i mean do we do we care if you know why not i think you know it would be it would be difficult
[ 563.20- 567.32] MEE073: yeah i dunno i dunno it does not really matter if we just unwittingly filter these out
[ 567.80- 569.98] FEO072: but it would be difficult if you know
[ 570.00- 582.04] FEO072: if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading you know top five dialog acts and then the little brackets but they are not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
[ 570.00- 579.68] MEE071: than real words at the moment but i could change that so i do not know what we want to display that is what i am i think that is what i am asking you really
[ 582.16- 583.02] MEE073: yeah
[ 583.00- 588.32] FEO070: oh that is well done
[ 583.52- 583.88] FEO072: because
[ 587.06- 589.20] MEE071: all is a lot all is like twenty five
[ 590.98- 592.76] MEE071: diamond x yeah
[ 591.32- 592.60] FEO072: for the speaker yeah
[ 594.26- 595.04] FEO070: yeah
[ 599.20- 600.00] FEO070: thanks i am all
[ 600.00- 612.86] FEO070: interested in this guy cause he seems to be funny
[ 603.16- 605.12] FEO072: no i would not yeah
[ 609.22- 610.00] FEO072: exactly yeah
[ 612.12- 629.26] MEE071: i think we should have the global top five that cause each speaker has got a top whatever and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialog x for the speaker and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker is top dialog x
[ 613.52- 614.78] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 615.96- 617.72] FEO072: yeah yep
[ 619.98- 624.00] FEO072: yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another
[ 625.08- 630.00] FEO072: but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones
[ 630.00- 631.20] FEO072: and then
[ 630.64- 633.24] MEE071: either of those would do you but it would start to take a while to space if you do not have
[ 635.42- 649.78] MEE071: well you could have no you do not need that so you s cause it is cause it is a speaker window the speaker characterization window comes up so you have got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting and then the top five in that meet in global or top five this meeting and then the rest is obvious and yeah
[ 645.44- 648.28] FEO072: you follow the rules on that
[ 647.34- 655.48] MEE073: actually yeah this is good for browsing though it is perfect i mean that is sort of it is like it was wanted here in the last few weeks cause you know it was one of the
[ 655.36- 657.52] FEO072: yeah see that is what speaker characterization gives you
[ 657.50- 658.88] MEE073: exactly it is fine
[ 659.34- 660.00] FEO072: who is the one who
[ 660.48- 660.88] MEE071: that ok
[ 662.54- 686.32] MEE071: but it some often the interesting ones do not occur things like joke do not occur very often well they do sometimes but they are not that common one guy has top five joke one of them is joke he is an undergrad that is what i am saying
[ 663.08- 690.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 663.68- 664.16] FEO072: yeah
[ 666.92- 689.98] FEO072: so is is this percentage then if you say like joke for this speaker is percentage i dunno twenty is that the what percentage of his speech is joke or
[ 688.40- 688.76] MEE071: yeah
[ 690.00- 692.32] FEO072: w what what percentage of the dialog are
[ 692.72- 720.00] MEE071: yeah
[ 693.90- 696.68] FEO072: the jokes yeah yeah
[ 697.80- 698.16] FEO072: ok
[ 706.62- 706.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 720.44- 728.72] MEE071: what percentage of the dialog acts that he makes are jokes in the meeting and globally separately so one is slow and yeah
[ 722.60- 726.42] MEE073: it is kind of ok yeah well it is not a real joke anyways
[ 723.44- 723.96] FEO072: yeah
[ 726.64- 728.64] FEO070: yeah the top left
[ 730.10- 737.44] FEO072: yeah yeah i mean just keep it as simple as
[ 730.56- 737.90] MEE071: i think most things are coded with a dialog act a lot of them are coded with a z which means no label so i just ignored that a little it is just boring
[ 737.78- 738.04] MEE073: yeah
[ 739.44- 750.00] MEE071: and statement which is boring and also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that so they put they put the the dialog act and then they put
[ 740.92- 747.28] FEO070: what do you suggest
[ 741.16- 748.28] MEE073: ok that is not true so that is sort of complemented now or is that the first possible super factor ok that is not
[ 750.00- 764.04] MEE071: a diva a code on the name put that outside just ignored any any quality material cause it is going to have to be with yeah yeah somebody else is doing so yeah you have to be original about your material it is back credit to you
[ 751.92- 756.12] FEO070: we have a big yellow end maybe
[ 752.96- 753.44] MEE073: ok
[ 755.04- 773.64] MEE073: i am an apodite by now i will just recompile the m browsers and then just get that yeah well so it will uses my part as well when i am in the end search yeah actually do we have like naming convention for s our source files just prefix them with an n and it is sort of
[ 756.12- 757.96] FEO070: we have not seen that before
[ 757.96- 772.24] FEO070: it would be super that way yeah very good
[ 761.48- 762.40] FEO072: you will yeah
[ 764.78- 764.92] FEO072: yeah
[ 766.56- 767.02] FEO072: sounds good
[ 768.12- 769.68] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 772.96- 776.36] FEO072: yeah i was thinking that it sort of turned out that way a bit did not it
[ 774.24- 775.60] MEE071: yeah that is what i mean yeah
[ 775.78- 779.96] MEE073: yeah yeah that is sort of what i was doing like for your stuff do you have
[ 776.72- 780.00] MEE071: yeah i just have to i have just finished
[ 780.00- 786.80] MEE071: there might be some publishing if i remember but i think it is pretty much complete so i will do that tonight just put it out there so you can start using it
[ 781.64- 782.48] MEE073: ok ok
[ 783.68- 788.76] MEE073: that does not matter no it does not matter at this point no i just came curious about thinking about future stuff maybe
[ 783.92- 785.04] FEO072: why are they so tight
[ 787.20- 787.72] FEO072: oh
[ 789.94- 790.16] FEO070: well
[ 790.92- 791.64] MEE073: yeah that is true too
[ 792.82- 794.06] MEE073: yeah yeah does not matter
[ 797.70- 799.68] MEE073: yeah ok
[ 804.36- 804.64] MEE073: ok
[ 806.04- 810.00] FEO072: i have one one m one little question that i reckon we should have the
[ 809.40- 810.00] MEE071: no i just
[ 810.00- 811.56] FEO072: it will i can not put on a browser
[ 810.00- 813.60] MEE071: what is called meeting and speaker well i can change it if you want
[ 814.56- 825.48] FEO072: well no i think it is yeah the top left at the moment they have got an x which is you know an x t and it is sort of a bit cheeky to use that so
[ 815.52- 815.92] MEE071: yeah
[ 818.64- 820.70] MEE071: you could put it in a third in a p package
[ 819.64- 820.76] MEE073: oh yeah
[ 821.82- 822.60] MEE071: maybe we got a little
[ 824.10- 833.72] MEE071: well it does not seem to make any difference i have never ever used the driving packages does not it make any difference it is not just in the same directory it works so sorry
[ 825.24- 825.84] MEE073: so
[ 827.20- 828.80] MEE073: yeah right
[ 827.70- 839.72] FEO072: no not something original what do you suggest the only thing i could think of was an m but
[ 834.56- 839.98] FEO070: we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how did the i think if
[ 838.48- 839.88] MEE073: yeah i know yeah same thing
[ 840.00- 843.20] FEO070: improve your browsing skills
[ 842.88- 848.28] MEE071: well you can double click on it oh oh yeah i know you can yeah
[ 846.18- 848.78] MEE073: alright
[ 846.36- 846.60] FEO070: sure
[ 849.76- 851.08] FEO072: it would be su for that
[ 850.88- 857.00] MEE073: super size reading browser
[ 853.42- 857.36] MEE071: yeah we have something else just for a little microsoft gif like that
[ 858.60- 858.88] MEE073: yeah
[ 862.58- 868.24] MEE073: just probably basic just text font and just something nice something solid maybe maybe
[ 866.56- 866.96] FEO072: yeah
[ 868.64- 870.00] FEO072: i mean it is tiny so we can not really
[ 870.00- 874.00] FEO072: put more than one character really or one sort of simple yeah
[ 871.32- 872.02] MEE073: yeah exactly
[ 871.76- 872.40] MEE071: m b
[ 873.76- 879.88] MEE073: anybody have any artistic talent no no it is ok
[ 874.84- 878.84] MEE071: alright
[ 878.92- 880.64] FEO072: yeah well i can d
[ 880.24- 886.48] FEO070: i guess that is why we have a separate speech lab cause yeah
[ 881.76- 893.06] MEE073: yeah it is possible some people have balance some people have some balance people alright maybe i will check see if i can find anyone
[ 882.78- 887.64] MEE071: alright
[ 882.80- 900.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 890.80- 892.96] FEO070: yeah yeah
[ 894.46- 899.98] FEO070: i am running some troubles with the in the canva found another package i
[ 895.24- 895.54] MEE073: ok
[ 897.52- 898.72] MEE071: yeah you are going to get like three
[ 898.08- 900.00] MEE073: how do you add that to the
[ 900.00- 907.78] FEO070: instead of writing it from scratch cause it will fall i do not know just know that i have not pulled around it much but
[ 900.00- 904.92] MEE073: to the java program is it just basic people ok
[ 902.20- 904.60] FEO072: i am not sure i think
[ 909.54- 916.80] MEE071: do you think we are doing m s c s in informatics in the beginning it is possible some people have valid some people have
[ 909.76- 910.10] MEE073: well
[ 910.08- 916.90] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it there but i will have to import it somehow i am not quite sure how that is
[ 910.36- 914.24] FEO070: we will see what happens in the next few days
[ 912.84- 915.00] MEE073: just in the main frame ok ok
[ 916.80- 922.24] MEE071: yeah
[ 916.88- 917.28] MEE073: ok
[ 919.12- 920.78] FEO072: yeah
[ 920.16- 924.06] MEE073: also it will do the automatic scrunching down if it is present oh cool
[ 920.84- 922.32] FEO070: yeah i do not think about that
[ 931.56- 934.16] FEO072: yes
[ 933.52- 941.30] MEE071: it is really easy you do it in one of the whatever the main window is that you set gif or some set set picture or something like that
[ 934.32- 937.32] MEE073: i know it is a distincting s distinctive experience i guess
[ 936.96- 938.88] FEO072: oh yes
[ 939.68- 941.40] FEO070: i guess i will try it now
[ 940.92- 946.46] FEO072: no
[ 942.72- 943.12] MEE073: ok
[ 944.52- 954.36] MEE073: so we get sound on these machines actually have you ever managed oh yeah you must have yeah i have got plenty sort of music on the dice machines right ok
[ 945.92- 946.40] FEO070: see
[ 947.24- 949.88] MEE071: yeah i think you just give it a file name in terms of in those
[ 951.96- 955.00] MEE071: yeah yeah just stick it in the corners of the yeah yeah
[ 956.76- 959.98] MEE073: oh right right i have they have them on the front too yeah
[ 957.56- 958.00] FEO072: if
[ 959.36- 960.00] FEO072: if the
[ 960.00- 968.10] FEO072: sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to re root and sometimes your key does not work yeah
[ 960.28- 971.76] FEO070: yeah i did not expect this course to be so much of that job that is feels like it is it is a job of course yeah
[ 961.84- 978.30] MEE071: you could even have some sound when it comes on and go do do do do welcome to the meeting no i have to do it in the
[ 962.72- 964.84] MEE073: yeah ok
[ 968.00- 968.24] MEE073: right
[ 969.92- 970.02] MEE073: kay
[ 972.54- 982.48] MEE073: yes yeah a little out of audio ok ok well this this looks good
[ 975.56- 976.30] FEO070: yeah
[ 983.18- 987.02] MEE071: no no but i think if you put headphones in it will just play it just normal
[ 993.04- 994.64] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 998.42- 999.52] MEE071: sometimes it really says
[1001.40-1001.66] MEE073: yeah
[1002.52-1004.24] MEE071: yes
[1003.14-1007.76] MEE073: and we are going to be trying to get the output from that i do not know still have not found out if it is
[1009.00-1020.00] MEE073: feasible to open up more than one well as many n n nome objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were going to like figure that the ranking did make sense like to be looking through the highest ranked one
[1018.48-1019.16] FEO070: so
[1020.00-1028.92] MEE073: on is first so if we are going to look through only five of them just pick the top five to to do the the search and since that is probably what we are looking for anyways
[1026.52-1030.80] FEO070: i thought we changed it to friday
[1032.04-1032.88] FEO070: yeah
[1038.28-1049.98] MEE073: sir maybe i will try yeah yeah that would be a surprise cause i am bad at that
[1050.00-1050.48] MEE073: and then
[1053.82-1054.62] MEE073: yeah sure
[1059.60-1060.00] FEO072: yeah
[1060.04-1063.00] MEE073: and then practical job i have
[1061.86-1067.34] FEO072: in fact it is a n x t package
[1065.02-1070.24] MEE073: yeah cool yeah how do you guys find the documentation for next year
[1065.76-1074.44] MEE071: i still can not make it run t and t from jogger yeah well
[1071.46-1072.32] FEO072: yeah
[1071.62-1074.40] MEE073: yeah exactly that is my belief as well
[1073.70-1080.00] FEO072: i mean sometimes i have methods that do not have any explanation to them at all so you are just like right i will try this
[1078.00-1078.42] MEE073: yeah
[1080.00-1084.28] FEO072: just i do not see what i should say
[1080.24-1081.78] FEO070: no so we can
[1082.08-1083.40] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1083.08-1087.64] FEO070: yeah does not matter cause the end of this friday
[1088.04-1092.64] MEE071: it is a job of course it is a practical job
[1089.16-1100.44] FEO070: but oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah too much now but yeah monday
[1091.04-1095.92] MEE073: yeah ok well it is still i guess research platform yeah
[1096.00-1096.92] MEE071: cool
[1097.56-1097.82] MEE073: yeah
[1099.12-1102.36] MEE073: yeah that is true ok i am just curious
[1100.36-1103.36] MEE071: rubbish
[1102.12-1104.52] FEO070: we will try and do it monday i mean we could
[1106.12-1107.72] FEO070: shall we make it up monday
[1108.36-1109.12] MEE071: yeah i think it was
[1108.76-1109.26] FEO070: or
[1108.84-1110.00] MEE073: so did we have a
[1110.00-1129.32] MEE073: a date for when we actually want the system done i thought we said i thought we did yeah i thought we changed it to the tenth or something cause the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things you know oh we should do this should we should we
[1110.60-1122.32] MEE071: so it does yeah and it it was mainly generated by going to generate java doc and just went pf splat it all out and then delivered it to a com a com a
[1112.06-1112.48] FEO070: should we
[1113.80-1114.20] FEO072: righty
[1113.84-1114.20] FEO070: yeah
[1115.80-1117.36] FEO070: just sh like
[1115.92-1116.96] FEO072: this is a
[1121.52-1122.64] FEO070: yeah just
[1125.06-1129.46] MEE071: yeah it is good to know what methods are there so without having to look at the source code so
[1129.68-1130.00] FEO070: yeah
[1131.04-1139.32] MEE073: so i do not do we want to set an actual hard deadline or like do you when exactly were we going to start the evaluation
[1131.20-1131.64] MEE071: i am just kidding
[1132.68-1133.70] MEE071: just let us see what we have here
[1134.82-1135.96] FEO070: yeah
[1135.64-1137.00] FEO072: yeah i think we should
[1137.88-1138.20] FEO070: yeah
[1140.00-1144.16] FEO072: problem because steve has not given us any details has not he
[1142.28-1145.24] FEO070: what so he is supposed to be give us this update and then we can
[1143.60-1160.60] MEE073: yeah ok well we yeah i guess we we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah come up with scenarios that sort of thing i mean that is that is fairly straightforward i mean we could actually find like yeah exactly that is true just brainstorm yeah yeah
[1144.42-1146.80] MEE071: today was not it
[1148.78-1149.16] FEO070: ok
[1149.76-1151.52] MEE071: ok
[1150.46-1151.20] FEO072: that is true
[1153.68-1162.10] FEO070: cause we are going to get an email on our l s e this to proceed basically yeah
[1154.88-1156.80] FEO072: i i am sure we could do that in like a meeting
[1157.98-1159.88] FEO072: and make it up to the break yeah
[1163.10-1170.00] FEO072: the thing is yeah we had the the deadline as friday but we will not be able to do an evaluation during the weekend
[1170.00-1173.12] FEO072: anyway so i think we could say monday
[1170.12-1170.28] FEO070: yeah
[1170.64-1171.40] MEE073: yeah that is true
[1173.20-1173.52] MEE073: yeah
[1173.84-1188.48] FEO070: well they are going to use need but they are going to so they are just going to do the perception projects and things like that so yeah you need them behind the scenes you need to use each other for this
[1175.36-1175.72] MEE073: yeah
[1175.88-1177.28] FEO072: and that would give us the whole idea
[1177.72-1188.04] MEE073: to what kind of this one yeah i have i have got my d n l g presentation on monday which was a paper
[1192.68-1193.40] MEE073: yeah i think so
[1201.32-1205.08] MEE073: well probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess but
[1206.76-1217.56] MEE073: we will probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him like we could send him an email but i do not know if these are around here he is not around this week is he or that is why i think that is why we did not have the the meeting
[1215.04-1216.30] FEO072: i do not know i think it works
[1219.00-1219.44] FEO072: yeah
[1219.40-1220.04] MEE073: alright ok
[1221.80-1227.72] MEE073: yeah sure although do we really want the answer so if we do not ask we can push it off but
[1225.44-1229.92] FEO072: yeah exactly yeah at the end we will say you but you never gave
[1230.00-1231.96] FEO072: just any test subjects
[1230.28-1232.20] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1234.38-1243.94] FEO072: well sorta that is how i understand it he would he would make something up yeah find some people that is how i understood it the thing is you know
[1238.76-1244.64] FEO070: yeah one one dude off the street one again
[1240.12-1243.08] MEE073: yeah yeah yeah that is
[1245.36-1258.08] FEO070: one is a man and one i dunno maybe we should just have two yeah
[1246.30-1248.98] MEE071: yeah maybe it is just the dialing tool
[1246.66-1249.18] MEE073: right we are looking for volunteer
[1249.54-1260.00] FEO072: yes i think if we if we do not get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
[1250.12-1252.00] MEE071: send them an email it will probably read them anyway
[1260.00-1260.20] FEO070: yeah
[1260.00-1273.88] FEO072: it is not going to take long it is only going to be half an hour maybe
[1260.36-1263.48] MEE073: yeah if they have time start finding people
[1261.92-1262.36] MEE071: yeah
[1263.48-1264.38] FEO070: same
[1265.64-1267.08] MEE071: he said he m he would try
[1266.72-1268.24] MEE073: yeah i know but
[1270.00-1275.32] MEE073: yeah yeah that is true yeah that is true yeah yeah
[1271.56-1271.78] FEO070: yeah
[1273.60-1275.38] FEO070: yeah it is two to the twenty second
[1276.52-1276.84] FEO072: yeah
[1277.12-1277.28] FEO070: yeah
[1278.66-1290.00] MEE073: yeah actually some of my friends of mine in different programs might might be more willing have more of a break so they have like an idea get a range of types of people as well like not like highly computer like
[1281.60-1282.12] FEO070: ok so
[1283.92-1284.44] FEO070: well
[1288.48-1290.00] FEO072: i mean yeah what
[1290.00-1293.96] FEO070: well i understand yeah that is the first thing yeah so it is not the yeah
[1290.00-1293.00] FEO072: and like you know led ex literate too yeah
[1290.00-1297.52] MEE073: not you know let it accelerate to yeah i think that might be good as well is it a wider range of people
[1296.56-1297.16] FEO072: you should not
[1297.76-1301.40] FEO070: it is not a good friday if that is not
[1299.48-1320.00] MEE073: i do not think like three or four maybe that would be good yeah i think that yeah yeah exactly like the thing that did an h c i course a while ago and it says let us put these yeah those three people yeah and that was fine then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people
[1302.64-1306.72] FEO072: yeah yeah i think that yeah no
[1302.76-1305.88] FEO070: no
[1307.88-1308.12] FEO070: no
[1309.56-1310.04] FEO072: like
[1312.00-1312.52] FEO070: ok
[1314.60-1318.28] FEO070: no evaluation
[1315.96-1316.32] FEO072: maybe
[1320.00-1325.72] MEE073: people yeah yeah oh yeah we do not want to
[1321.02-1321.48] FEO072: really
[1324.92-1327.00] FEO072: how can you get a range of people if you have three
[1327.52-1329.86] MEE071: so how many people have you had to try and cause
[1328.40-1329.24] FEO070: but not like the
[1328.84-1340.64] MEE073: no one one dude of the street visible in the audience
[1329.44-1330.56] FEO072: what are the students
[1331.52-1333.58] MEE071: yeah really yeah
[1332.72-1335.92] FEO072: yeah and they are ones plus people man
[1335.28-1340.88] MEE071: no
[1338.58-1347.36] FEO072: yeah then we should just have two
[1341.76-1349.98] MEE073: it is going forward but yeah if he finds them then that is cool
[1350.00-1352.04] MEE073: difference to people
[1353.06-1362.82] FEO072: another thing we have the we have the the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something whatever it is nearly two weeks
[1355.16-1355.78] MEE073: oh right now
[1357.04-1366.68] MEE071: yeah one computer scientist and one one dude off the street and one
[1362.04-1362.68] MEE073: yeah
[1364.70-1370.34] FEO072: oh it is two yeah it is two weeks then do we have to have done the evaluation by then
[1366.76-1369.40] MEE071: oh
[1367.40-1367.80] MEE073: ok
[1372.40-1379.98] MEE073: i thought the evaluation maybe for the report so it is not necessarily twenty fifth twenty fifth is is it i is it that is
[1372.84-1374.90] MEE071: but my bad one was yes you have four
[1375.60-1380.00] FEO070: yeah oh we have a three
[1380.00-1380.56] FEO070: b two
[1380.00-1383.00] FEO072: that is the first thing no the first thing i think yeah that is the first thing
[1380.00-1380.80] MEE073: what i understand
[1382.48-1408.32] MEE073: i thought you said twenty f th even though it is good friday although ok yeah yeah it is good friday oh yeah easter two days no no well it was not originally either so yeah yeah ok ok ok so that gives us two days to do the evaluation no evaluation i am not
[1382.52-1382.92] MEE071: yeah
[1385.68-1386.20] FEO070: or three
[1387.80-1388.08] FEO070: right
[1387.92-1389.24] FEO072: is that good friday already
[1392.20-1392.72] FEO072: wow
[1394.16-1396.76] MEE071: two weeks two weeks
[1394.32-1394.80] FEO072: no
[1396.92-1400.08] FEO072: well it i am sure on the website it says thursday yeah
[1397.60-1397.88] FEO070: yeah
[1400.88-1401.12] MEE071: yeah
[1402.80-1407.84] FEO070: even our timeline we are in the twenty fifth and that is friday i think
[1406.16-1409.60] MEE071: so the the most important handi is oh right is that is that the flyby
[1407.28-1410.00] FEO072: well you know the the question is i do we need the evaluation
[1409.28-1410.00] FEO070: yeah
[1410.00-1416.22] FEO070: i am just that is why i am trying to find his his his that is why i
[1410.00-1411.08] FEO072: ration for the presentation
[1411.18-1412.48] MEE071: that is twenty fourth
[1411.96-1416.44] MEE073: i did not think so necessarily i would not i would not assume but we should ask them
[1416.72-1419.28] FEO072: we should definitely ask him because if not then
[1417.40-1417.84] MEE071: yeah
[1419.40-1421.14] MEE071: yeah that is good idea oh yeah
[1420.16-1422.68] FEO070: i do not have a big part in the twenty fours yet
[1423.12-1423.48] MEE071: yeah
[1425.56-1427.68] FEO070: end of lectures
[1426.40-1431.20] MEE073: yeah that is probably tight it is a good target it is a good yeah
[1430.56-1431.76] FEO072: yeah you might be right
[1436.06-1437.28] FEO070: oh it is actually twenty four
[1440.92-1442.04] MEE073: right
[1445.24-1447.50] FEO072: because we needed to write a presentation as well
[1447.12-1447.36] MEE073: yeah
[1449.00-1461.00] MEE073: it is funny no it is it is just funny that you know have it finished by monday cause after monday i am pretty much free for about a week or so it is like if we had you know a bit more time
[1451.32-1458.68] MEE071: m we should have it we should try and have it done by then anyway i think otherwise it will start getting a bit tight otherwise
[1455.26-1457.70] FEO072: exactly that is the point
[1459.16-1465.86] FEO072: yeah yeah well i am not free after this monday but i am free like after the eighteen year
[1462.48-1470.00] MEE071: we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming a week no yeah well basically for tuesday start the evaluation with
[1463.04-1463.44] MEE073: oh ok
[1464.56-1470.00] MEE073: oh the next one ok yeah yeah i am free this after this monday and well well what else
[1470.00-1472.02] MEE071: to pretty much straight away and then get
[1470.00-1478.92] MEE073: s s p t that is that is easy compared to normal i mean i am not even reasonable for that yeah yeah
[1472.60-1477.84] FEO072: yeah because i do not have anything after the eighteen department yes
[1473.64-1475.40] MEE071: cause yeah and then get
[1476.96-1479.50] MEE071: and we have to write the reportage and everything to write everything
[1480.58-1480.94] MEE073: oh
[1480.68-1483.06] FEO072: well that is in on the eighteen
[1481.32-1488.50] FEO070: did he say anything about like what he expects of the final report and stuff like things or
[1483.78-1487.64] MEE073: you did not know that how is yours
[1486.70-1486.94] MEE071: ok
[1490.60-1490.96] MEE073: yeah
[1492.32-1493.32] FEO072: so
[1497.00-1500.00] MEE073: oh ok maybe that was us then not him
[1500.00-1502.92] MEE073: yeah oh actually i do not know what that is actually
[1500.22-1505.18] MEE071: just kidding
[1503.00-1505.04] FEO070: i mean how long were
[1505.72-1507.56] MEE073: scripture yeah firstly twenty four
[1508.14-1520.08] MEE071: and you must have your research proposal is that in only eighteen yeah no doubt at all yeah
[1510.08-1511.64] MEE073: definite resubmission but
[1511.44-1520.08] FEO070: yeah cause this i mean we have interim report of seven pages and that is we can
[1514.64-1517.08] MEE073: oh well now you can yeah
[1520.08-1525.18] FEO070: seven pages yeah we could probably just expand that
[1520.24-1521.46] FEO072: so
[1522.08-1523.80] MEE073: so twenty four so you please
[1523.36-1525.36] FEO072: and you are fancy writing them in email
[1526.60-1529.08] FEO070: i mean cause it i mean a lot of it is going to be the same thing
[1527.56-1528.88] MEE073: right
[1529.80-1530.00] MEE073: just
[1530.00-1533.40] MEE073: to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration or
[1531.78-1538.16] FEO070: yeah and then i mean write about the evaluation yeah well that is going to be quite a bit suspicious but
[1533.42-1535.48] FEO072: that yep and
[1536.48-1538.60] MEE073: we should have it done anyway ok yes sure
[1539.16-1541.12] FEO070: so i do not think
[1541.28-1547.46] MEE073: hopefully but i mean is that is that a part of the demonstration do they want that information the evaluation right
[1541.64-1544.36] FEO072: but it is still important since it is it is a new
[1542.60-1544.72] FEO070: they just kind of be
[1545.84-1553.32] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place and
[1546.82-1547.14] FEO070: yeah
[1551.56-1551.72] MEE073: right
[1556.60-1557.36] FEO072: what was the other one
[1558.72-1559.98] FEO072: basically
[1560.00-1570.18] FEO072: how is how is it going with your evaluation proposal have you got people yet for us what you are thinking and when
[1565.88-1566.28] MEE073: oh
[1577.42-1577.90] FEO072: no
[1577.80-1586.56] MEE073: through a few little things just made some comments at the last meeting just generally how it all integrates blah blah blah and all this kind of stuff yeah
[1585.30-1588.70] FEO072: do we know did you ever say how long it was supposed to be
[1589.00-1589.98] MEE073: no
[1590.00-1592.16] MEE073: i would expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages
[1591.80-1593.66] FEO072: yeah
[1594.06-1597.68] MEE073: although it is fifty percent of the mark i think is it i think
[1597.84-1601.20] FEO072: but we can write a lot on the i think we should we should write everything
[1599.50-1599.88] MEE073: yeah
[1601.20-1603.44] MEE073: exactly well we have a bit of time to do that yeah
[1604.72-1605.24] MEE073: that is going to be good
[1610.08-1611.76] FEO072: so yeah
[1619.00-1620.00] MEE073: yeah just
[1620.00-1622.00] MEE073: to fine tune in your detailed and
[1620.52-1620.92] FEO072: sure
[1623.16-1623.60] MEE073: more detailed
[1625.88-1626.76] FEO072: yeah i would think so
[1627.16-1630.12] MEE073: yeah that could be yeah that could easily be like five or six pages
[1632.36-1633.00] FEO072: no i should leave it
[1636.24-1636.60] MEE073: ok
[1640.52-1643.26] FEO072: so do you want to write me an email then that would be good
[1642.52-1642.84] MEE073: sure
[1648.50-1650.00] FEO072: and when i get home today
[1650.00-1652.96] FEO072: which will be before
[1656.20-1661.92] FEO072: before i have passed six i will make that file readable writable and everything
[1660.44-1662.64] MEE073: oh yeah sure yeah no no big rush
[1663.16-1665.06] FEO072: well i i will
[1665.00-1669.52] MEE073: although just together all the way so i am not sure i am going to remember to do that tomorrow
[1669.06-1676.00] FEO072: well i will i will need your snippets of code or it would be good if i had them by tomorrow evening
[1674.28-1674.54] MEE073: yeah
[1676.40-1676.62] MEE073: yeah
[1678.20-1678.40] MEE073: yeah
[1679.36-1680.00] FEO072: oh i was going to ask
[1680.00-1681.04] FEO072: ask
[1682.88-1684.34] FEO072: at the moment in your search window
[1685.64-1686.56] FEO072: how is it organized
[1687.32-1695.64] MEE073: just basic pretty much like the interim do you want to do you have the interim stuff just sorta like google type thing and just
[1695.08-1703.96] FEO072: but at the beginning when you have not searched yet is the is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty ok
[1701.56-1702.88] MEE073: yeah yeah
[1705.16-1707.64] MEE073: and as these come up it will just p p pop over there
[1708.82-1710.00] FEO072: and then if you
[1710.00-1711.68] FEO072: you i do not know double click on one
[1712.32-1720.72] MEE073: it does not do anything yet like that is that is the other big part i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows
[1714.56-1714.84] FEO072: ok
[1724.28-1724.62] FEO072: yeah
[1724.60-1734.84] MEE073: because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics that was why i was sort of deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one
[1728.88-1729.64] FEO072: yeah
[1737.00-1739.98] MEE073: yeah so so there is a couple of those little things that
[1738.02-1740.00] FEO072: well this this is the icon button
[1740.00-1743.80] FEO072: right
[1740.00-1745.30] MEE073: yeah exactly yeah and makes more sense
[1745.60-1754.50] FEO072: yeah maybe you want to do left handed yeah one left click highlights the the result in whatever you have got open
[1754.84-1761.98] MEE073: ok is that how it works in the other ones in like the other windows like the various like if we are in the topic or
[1758.04-1758.46] FEO072: which one
[1759.68-1768.48] FEO072: yeah usually one left click it is highlights it cross highlights everything i think yeah
[1770.00-1780.48] MEE073: ticular w window that you want me to mimic its behavior then like just find it in the program and just say ok just have this one does it so if it is like the topic window or the whatever
[1773.08-1773.96] FEO070: well you are so
[1775.12-1776.04] FEO070: you you do not you are not
[1780.08-1781.84] FEO072: well it is difficult because
[1786.62-1792.68] MEE073: so i can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring them to you
[1786.80-1787.52] FEO072: well you could look at
[1793.48-1797.96] FEO072: no it is difficult because the the transcription window does cross highlighting
[1799.24-1799.92] FEO072: in a very
[1800.00-1805.84] FEO072: awkward way because he has to find the topic first that was that was a pain
[1802.88-1803.08] MEE073: ok
[1807.44-1823.64] FEO072: and when you when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop topic and and that works when you when you left double click on a topic on a meeting sorry then it loads it
[1824.44-1824.68] MEE073: kay
[1824.68-1825.32] FEO072: so you could
[1826.44-1827.68] FEO072: you could take that for loading
[1830.00-1835.24] FEO072: we have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click they do not close
[1835.56-1843.96] FEO070: it should be very simple to just get the topics and the summaries from using that text extractor thingy you wrote right
[1837.24-1837.60] MEE073: ok
[1845.80-1848.64] MEE073: so one left click just highlights that is it is right
[1846.32-1847.94] FEO070: it looks like one
[1848.46-1855.46] FEO072: highlights yeah i mean hi obviously highlights whatever you have clicked on here but also highlights
[1850.66-1850.92] FEO070: yeah
[1853.00-1854.00] MEE073: oh just the item
[1853.08-1857.40] FEO070: what should we just feel like i dunno i do not know
[1855.68-1856.96] MEE073: the transcript or whatever it is
[1858.48-1859.66] FEO072: actually it is difficult because
[1858.84-1859.08] MEE073: yeah
[1863.92-1865.44] MEE073: if you if you could just
[1864.84-1873.32] FEO072: because you you do not you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be ov well i suppose if you have a d if you have a local search then it could cross out like
[1874.68-1878.20] FEO070: time to start up time for the start up
[1875.72-1877.84] MEE073: yeah that should be possible
[1879.32-1885.08] FEO072: because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you have only got one meeting open then you can not cross out anything
[1879.60-1879.76] MEE073: yeah
[1882.20-1882.44] MEE073: right
[1885.48-1890.00] MEE073: although yeah this this will this is actually different from how we print it up here like if we are doing a
[1890.00-1919.96] MEE073: global search then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up all this stuff the various meetings that found those terms and then we will either you know multi select or you know choose the one we want to actually do this i think multi select would make the most sense well just if there is like three of the top meetings like like we said before language we are looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones to actually look for the terms we are not loading it out of all seventy six meetings or seventy five or whatever it is so the the results from that will you know
[1896.64-1898.14] FEO072: oh i see what you mean yeah ok
[1902.78-1914.26] FEO072: well i in any case if you left click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight if not it can not
[1904.40-1909.28] FEO070: yeah w w that was like yeah if i would make a just an index
[1912.62-1912.80] FEO070: what
[1915.08-1919.96] FEO070: well i w i mean i i think it is not the first priority maybe but i am
[1920.00-1921.16] FEO070: yeah
[1920.00-1934.64] MEE073: f narrow down what we are going to use for the local search so we will just do the local search on those ones that are chosen and if we can yeah so it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least
[1941.52-1944.28] FEO070: yeah
[1942.54-1945.08] MEE073: yes yes exactly
[1946.16-1946.74] FEO072: can you make
[1947.80-1950.00] FEO072: is it very difficult to make a
[1950.00-1954.96] FEO072: another another gooey but only for a global search
[1955.00-1955.40] FEO070: yeah
[1955.36-1955.50] MEE073: ok
[1959.30-1966.52] FEO072: just just take that away the the local check box because they are not
[1964.96-1971.42] MEE071: yeah you have to start again and just do topics and stuff so yeah you have to get the topics out instead of the segments yeah
[1967.72-1969.74] FEO072: yeah because in the start up screen you can not have them
[1972.32-1980.00] FEO072: yeah would you make that that would be pretty handy everything else can just stay the same you know in fact you can just leave everything as it is
[1980.00-1981.32] FEO072: is and just remove the check box
[1980.52-1983.64] FEO070: yeah yeah i think we just
[1984.84-1992.04] FEO070: see what steve says about the evaluation and then like hold it keep it watch by our email if we need it
[1985.84-1989.34] FEO072: ready or not
[1986.80-1989.48] MEE073: so that we search two different
[1991.56-1996.22] MEE073: right yeah that is actually a fairly
[1993.34-1995.56] FEO070: and then i guess what is the email sub state
[1997.88-1998.48] FEO070: anonly
[1999.88-2000.44] FEO070: dina
[2000.18-2005.96] MEE073: yeah local anyways yeah no no it is easy sure yeah so that is that is quite structurally
[2007.80-2007.96] MEE073: yeah
[2010.12-2012.40] FEO070: we can just email if we need a phone
[2015.88-2016.64] FEO070: i guess
[2016.68-2019.42] MEE073: yeah
[2019.18-2021.72] MEE071: so you are going to be able to do a global set of topics
[2023.16-2024.04] FEO070: right
[2025.68-2037.54] MEE071: is that what you mean yeah yeah ok yeah yeah ok yeah i did not think you would bother with that but yeah cool i did not think we were going to bother with that but yeah
[2027.10-2028.94] MEE073: yeah exactly
[2034.88-2037.16] MEE073: well it it kind of makes sense it does not it
[2039.04-2039.88] MEE073: so yeah
[2039.24-2039.60] FEO072: ok
[2039.60-2039.88] MEE071: yeah
[2040.00-2050.54] MEE073: be bothering with our topic stuff still or is that sort of gone like our own topic segment like since we can not do the labeling and all the rest we are still doing our topic segment you are you are making some
[2040.88-2041.24] FEO072: we are done
[2042.88-2043.32] MEE071: what we are
[2049.18-2054.40] MEE071: well we will certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it at the very least
[2052.48-2061.72] MEE073: but we are not going to be we will not be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they do not have labels probably
[2060.94-2070.00] MEE071: no exactly yeah yeah no i do not think we do that well yeah even
[2061.72-2069.62] MEE073: like label all the label ones ok if you have all the label twos i do not know ok
[2070.00-2077.14] MEE071: even if even if i happen to manage to make it do some keywords i do not think we can expect you to also come up with a search thing for it as well
[2075.76-2080.88] MEE073: yeah yeah well no it would be kind of straightforwardly if you are good it is a good idea is it is
[2078.76-2099.98] MEE071: yeah but if i c yeah yeah if i create x m l files well i am not going to do that i did have a look at trying to create x m l files and did not like the button emission really i suppose it is not it is it is as straightforward as writing an x m l file so it is but it is organizing the segment later that it would just look so complicated to get it
[2081.80-2082.20] FEO072: ok
[2084.32-2084.60] MEE073: yeah
[2100.00-2100.44] MEE071: from
[2102.04-2118.12] MEE071: the from a plain text file back into organized by who which speaker speaks what and how i am doing the segment i think that was the stupidest way they could ever have organized the whole thing as a last meeting about we have organized it by time not by speaker but yeah but
[2119.60-2122.00] MEE071: so i do not know what we are going to do with that
[2136.40-2136.60] MEE073: yeah
[2139.44-2139.72] MEE073: yeah
[2142.96-2143.16] MEE073: right
[2149.28-2150.12] MEE073: yeah
[2151.06-2153.68] MEE071: yeah we thought we need another meeting this week
[2153.72-2159.84] MEE073: probably not i mean just get work done i think that is what i have got to do
[2160.36-2160.68] MEE071: yeah
[2162.18-2162.42] MEE073: yeah
[2162.66-2162.96] MEE071: yeah

[  83.24-  84.04] MEO015: alright
[  90.00- 115.88] FEE013: surprisingly enough ok this is our agenda we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better feel more comfortable with each other then we will go do tool training talk about the project plan discuss our own ideas and everything and we have got twenty five minutes to do that as far as i can understand
[ 117.60- 120.00] FEE013: now we are developing a remote control
[ 120.00- 149.08] FEE013: you probably already know we want it to be original something that s people have not thought of it is not out in the shops trendy appealing to a wide market but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe even puches should be able to use it ok first is the functional design this is where we all go off and do our individual work
[ 138.78- 138.88] MEO015: yeah
[ 150.00- 160.96] FEE013: what needs need to be fulfilled by the product what effect the product has to have and how it is actually going to do that conceptual design
[ 162.32- 167.80] FEE013: what we are thinking how it is going to go and then the detailed design how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work
[ 170.36- 179.98] FEE013: ok right we are going to practice with the pens and draw our favorite animal on the whiteboard i will go first
[ 180.00- 185.80] FEE013: and some of s characteristics of an s l so

[ 446.72- 447.64] MEE014: oh
[ 451.28- 454.68] FEE016: it does not look like what i want it to be

[ 471.28- 480.00] FEE016: seagull right it is a tiger it is not a seagull could have been a seagull i would have thought it would be a seagull an eagle again i am thinking of
[ 471.76- 473.22] MEE014: oh yeah that is true that is true
[ 471.76- 472.68] MEO015: right
[ 480.00- 488.68] FEE016: the feet good enough i suppose they are also independent i will put that one down again
[ 489.86- 491.36] FEE013: ok
[ 489.88- 490.96] MEE014: the clinical
[ 490.28- 506.60] FEE016: indepen independent right but you say they are good at golf i think oh right i am not good at golf i say they are quite free spirited flying around everywhere doing their own thing
[ 494.32- 498.62] MEE014: yeah
[ 501.20- 504.66] FEE013: segal right not segal
[ 511.44- 519.52] FEE016: and very to pray on the idea of intrepid intrepid
[ 523.66- 526.76] FEE016: when we go to the press conference it is going to be ok
[ 528.68- 529.32] FEE016: yeah
[ 545.12- 547.66] MEE014: it is about something like yeah
[ 546.52- 547.20] FEE016: seventeen
[ 546.76- 551.50] MEO015: one point four is it is one point four you would make a lot of money or something
[ 550.84- 557.56] MEE014: yeah yeah something like that so yeah about seventeen seventeen pounds something like that
[ 552.60- 552.92] MEO015: yeah
[ 554.48- 555.14] FEE013: that is not true
[ 554.88- 555.96] FEE016: seventeen
[ 558.36- 562.28] FEE016: should we be making notes of this we can just refer to this later come on
[ 560.86- 561.20] MEE014: but
[ 561.12- 561.60] FEE013: ok
[ 563.12- 570.00] FEE013: that was fun right finance wise we have got a selling price at twenty five euros
[ 563.80- 564.28] FEE016: ok
[ 564.20- 570.00] MEE014: having having said that though do you want to get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment or something
[ 570.00- 575.32] FEE013: which i do not actually know what that is in pounds at all any ideas
[ 570.00- 578.08] MEE014: they are about twenty pounds anyway so yeah we had to buy one
[ 573.50- 574.24] FEE016: right
[ 575.84- 576.04] FEE016: so
[ 578.08- 583.92] FEE016: so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheepy cheepy option or
[ 583.88- 587.98] FEE013: fifteen seventeen ok that is expensive
[ 587.56- 589.60] MEO015: ok pretty cute technology
[ 590.96- 595.92] FEE013: i think so i think so i would be able to pull it up or to put it in the shared folder or something
[ 591.48- 592.16] MEE014: yeah
[ 592.04- 592.24] FEE016: kay
[ 600.36- 601.20] FEE016: in our first year
[ 603.88- 604.24] FEE013: yeah
[ 608.08- 621.48] FEE016: you have got market range international and you did say earlier it has got to be accessible and usable by the double edged groups just d we are not focusing on business market any particular thing it is everyone user oriented everyone ok
[ 608.14- 608.98] FEE013: i suppose the
[ 613.52- 617.82] FEE013: yeah production costs at twelve fifty so
[ 619.12- 629.36] FEE013: half of the selling price is taken up by building it and profit aim is fifty million euros which is a
[ 623.42- 625.40] FEE016: big target group
[ 631.28- 637.08] FEE013: y yes yeah i presume so so
[ 645.32- 645.60] FEE013: d
[ 649.12- 650.28] FEE013: no yeah
[ 653.56- 659.96] FEE013: so yes yes i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different
[ 657.24- 657.56] MEO015: oh
[ 658.12- 658.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 660.00- 670.24] FEE013: languages and things like that making it a key point just that it is going to be in international market like australia america things like that ok
[ 661.12- 661.88] FEE016: yeah
[ 661.24- 662.12] MEE014: yeah
[ 661.48- 662.24] MEO015: yeah right
[ 671.08- 671.68] FEE016: yeah
[ 671.10- 671.88] MEE014: yeah
[ 675.18- 676.72] MEE014: you use all the ones that you see
[ 675.20- 689.98] FEE013: what are your experiences with remote controls i mean i have got we got we had three videos a t v and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal
[ 678.60- 680.92] MEO015: you you want to integrate everything into one like
[ 681.24- 683.24] MEE014: yeah ok cause you
[ 681.88- 683.28] FEE016: ok cause y
[ 682.32- 682.72] MEO015: ok
[ 690.00- 704.72] FEE013: remote controls and that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we would have to reprogram it every now and again i think it was quite cheapy as well so that might have had something to do with it but that was quite good the fact that you could
[ 690.00- 706.06] FEE016: gram t v r videos and things but basically on off volume up and down channel one two that basic function i do not think i could go any further with it than that so but there has got to be something usable by someone like me as well
[ 697.06- 697.74] MEO015: maybe right
[ 699.96- 700.26] MEE014: yeah
[ 702.88- 719.98] MEO015: right i was thinking on the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user may have maybe have an l c d display or something like that like a mobile and with menus and if it is somewhat similar to what you have in mobile phone people might find it easier to browse
[ 705.96- 708.92] FEE013: did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you
[ 707.28- 707.66] FEE016: ok
[ 709.36- 714.04] MEE014: yeah my granddaughter is actually better than me at using teletext so
[ 718.64- 719.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 719.84- 720.00] FEE016: t
[ 720.00- 725.28] FEE016: it takes but there are some things like words that you do not necessarily understand symbols you are meant to understand that you do not
[ 720.00- 722.04] MEO015: and and then here also yeah
[ 723.72- 729.60] MEE014: yeah why it just needs to be as long as it is sort of self intuitive and you can can work out
[ 726.28- 728.96] MEO015: you need to say if it listen or not
[ 731.00- 741.94] MEE014: why everything is doing cause i mean menus on sort of neat phones now they have sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do
[ 735.00- 749.96] FEE013: yeah the main that is the main stuff anyway i mean and you do not want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the
[ 738.52- 738.98] FEE016: yeah
[ 744.44- 745.76] MEE014: but i do not know how
[ 745.60- 745.84] FEE016: look
[ 747.36- 747.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 749.80- 749.92] FEE016: i
[ 750.00- 751.76] FEE013: text button or something like that
[ 750.00- 764.48] FEE016: so that just raises a point i wondered what our design people think but you know on a mobile phone you can press the key and it gives you a menu it has got a menu display i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control like these so you have got a little l c d display
[ 750.18- 750.68] MEE014: oh yeah
[ 752.60- 752.96] FEE013: yeah
[ 757.40- 779.80] FEE013: when they are when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording things like that inside it cause it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at it is obvious what you are doing
[ 765.16- 779.32] MEE014: yeah i do not i do not know how for twenty five or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get you would you would have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l c d thing anyway so
[ 773.80- 775.90] FEE016: with menus yeah
[ 781.14- 781.48] FEE016: yeah
[ 782.36- 785.08] FEE013: what about the older generation what about granny and grandad s
[ 786.16- 793.64] FEE013: my grandad can answer his mobile phone but he could not even dream of texting or something like that
[ 791.36- 797.96] FEE016: yeah something like that can he program his remote control or is he basic with that too
[ 798.12- 801.44] FEE013: i do not think they tape things i do not think that is
[ 800.04- 800.60] FEE016: right
[ 803.26- 803.80] FEE016: right
[ 804.64- 809.96] FEE016: so that is the problem regardless of if any design modifications you you come up with that is going to be a problem
[ 810.00- 814.64] FEE016: but anyway with the older generation perhaps i know it is another issue to tackle that
[ 811.18- 813.24] FEE013: yeah i got you
[ 815.32- 815.70] MEO015: ok
[ 829.92- 830.20] MEE014: i do
[ 834.30- 840.00] FEE013: i do not know i do not i do not like the you know the new phones that are kind of got a windows based
[ 837.26- 837.60] MEE014: yeah
[ 840.20- 841.76] FEE013: running system
[ 842.96- 853.24] FEE013: i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the phone i did i have not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost but
[ 850.68- 851.68] MEE014: no no
[ 854.40- 855.16] FEE013: that is just me
[ 856.04- 856.68] MEO015: ok
[ 858.56- 859.08] MEO015: ok
[ 860.92- 869.24] MEO015: it might it might save up a bit of space instead of looking bulky it might look small but it might have its cost implications
[ 863.64- 864.30] FEE013: yeah
[ 865.50- 870.00] MEE014: yeah yeah just just
[ 868.72- 870.00] FEE016: is it possible that that
[ 870.00- 881.78] FEE016: for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books obviously it displays less on the screen it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing
[ 870.00- 894.64] MEE014: a quick thing about the about what you were saying about the does not does not need to be fashionable the so if i i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the the we put the fashion into electronics so i think i think the whole design thing might be quite i mean you do not you you can still have plastic and it look quite good but
[ 875.76- 877.48] FEE013: cause it has got that option as well
[ 881.86- 882.36] FEE013: yeah
[ 883.68- 899.96] FEE013: or what about kind of a dual function in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures obvious
[ 898.56- 898.90] MEE014: yeah
[ 900.00- 904.88] FEE013: symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that
[ 900.84- 901.44] FEE016: out
[ 902.00- 902.96] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 904.74- 917.56] FEE016: ok the other thing is just t t tacking into mobile phone design features again you could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over
[ 918.48- 923.04] FEE013: i think that is a cost thing i do not you do not know how much we are going to know about
[ 921.06- 921.40] FEE016: you do
[ 922.60- 923.44] MEE014: ok sorry
[ 926.02- 928.08] FEE013: yes no that is important
[ 926.78- 928.58] FEE016: yeah that is important no
[ 928.04- 928.38] MEO015: yeah
[ 929.48- 929.98] FEE013: like
[ 930.00- 942.44] FEE016: no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be light white plastic you know something that is easily molded and which is sorry i am treading on your territory guys
[ 938.84- 939.24] FEE013: yeah
[ 942.92- 949.94] FEE013: right ok we have got half an hour before the next meeting so we are all going to go off and do our individual things
[ 951.20- 959.52] FEE013: i think that is probably about it and then we will come back and raise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation
[ 961.08- 961.44] FEE013: sure
[ 975.06- 975.72] FEE016: i remember
[ 975.88- 976.44] FEE013: ok
[ 976.56- 977.12] FEE013: yeah
[ 976.90- 977.50] FEE016: ok
[ 979.14- 981.28] FEE016: sure yeah
[ 983.68- 989.92] FEE016: but yeah i mean it does not have to be that you know that that was my main point you do not have to use a metal i do not know if you
[ 990.00- 994.40] FEE016: using plastic does not make it cheaper i have to see what would it would it would probably yeah
[ 992.32- 994.00] FEE013: i would never probably
[ 995.04-1011.56] FEE013: i mean the sky remote controls and everything they are kind of molded and look a bit different than the tally west remote controls or silver plastic which looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that is stuff we can think about ok so let us break it up there
[1007.32-1007.94] FEE016: yeah
[1012.20-1012.30] FEE016: kay
[1012.40-1014.16] FEE013: ok so see you in half an hour
[1016.42-1018.48] FEE016: do we go back to room
[1017.76-1019.04] FEE013: i think so yeah

[ 100.62- 119.98] FEE013: equipment that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers wide age range not limiting anyone we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product we put flash in in electronics you know that kind of thing
[ 100.72- 100.94] MEO015: ok
[ 120.00- 129.48] FEE013: our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget that we might
[ 130.48- 144.12] FEE013: have a bit of oh oh you can see it ok dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like
[ 144.84- 149.98] FEE013: wanted to look uncluttered undaunted to the customer we discussed a flip open
[ 150.00- 159.36] FEE013: design reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming things like that
[ 161.20- 166.80] FEE013: kay three presentations i have got written here so
[ 168.68- 170.62] FEE013: shall we hear from marketing first
[ 171.00- 175.84] FEE016: is it ok if i postpone that till later i just want to get access to a little bit more information i think
[ 175.04- 177.32] FEE013: no that is fine that is fine
[ 176.50- 179.22] MEE014: ok yeah i will go first and then grab the
[ 179.08- 179.82] FEE013: ok
[ 182.12- 183.40] MEE014: ok
[ 191.56- 193.32] MEE014: ok press all press it
[ 194.00- 195.12] FEE013: f n
[ 195.96- 197.28] FEE013: function f eight
[ 196.82- 197.88] MEE014: ok
[ 200.96- 201.44] MEE014: ok
[ 203.64- 204.56] MEE014: maybe
[ 210.00- 210.62] MEE014: yep there we go
[ 212.50- 218.50] MEE014: kay this is the working design presented by me the industrial design that is drawn there
[ 219.96- 239.98] MEE014: kay this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so well the first thing question i was just what are we trying to design well a device which basically just sends the signal to the t v to change the state whether that be the power or the channel or the volume everything is just
[ 240.00- 246.92] MEE014: some sort of signal to change the state of the t v or other appliances sending the signal to
[ 249.02- 260.06] MEE014: so i decided i would have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that but although we will want to be taking
[ 261.48- 269.96] MEE014: ideas from other people we want to make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was not really my
[ 270.00- 299.96] MEE014: area because i am dealing with the inside really so yeah i ran out of time so i could not do this one as fun as the last one and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t v presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that can use use wireless and you do not need to send very much information most of them
[ 300.00- 322.22] MEE014: powered by some form of battery now r one i am i am not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control yeah sure
[ 319.14- 326.76] FEE016: yeah can i interject to ask a question is that appropriate are you saying the triple a batteries are support or the cams are compatible with the
[ 325.56- 329.96] MEE014: no no if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they are quite they are quite
[ 330.00- 330.96] FEE016: yeah
[ 330.00- 359.98] MEE014: chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in yeah but well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones one just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the battery across and which leads sort of on to the next point about them being small and easy to carry round now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller
[ 345.62- 345.92] FEE016: ok
[ 346.28- 346.62] FEE016: ok
[ 360.00- 360.36] MEE014: smaller
[ 361.64- 389.92] MEE014: now the main components i came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries cause otherwise it is not going to work as i said about the which batteries we were going to choose we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i infrared signal which we are going to
[ 390.00- 417.88] MEE014: used to send the information now these have a wireless range of up to about five meters which is sort of suitable for anyone who is watching their t v unless they are in a cinema which not much people do so as we are applying for the most audience that should be fine and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the interface designer
[ 420.00- 441.80] MEE014: what i had as the basic idea of what we want to do it is not a proper circuit i am not sure if it will work or not i am not even confident with those the real the real way you wire it on but anyway we have just got the the power going to the infrared bulb the chip and the u i interface
[ 437.68- 442.36] FEE013: ok thank you very much would you like to continue on from there
[ 441.36- 441.92] MEO015: yep
[ 443.36- 449.80] MEE014: which would basically when you when you have pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of
[ 445.76- 449.00] MEO015: so maybe with that we can do it with
[ 445.92- 448.54] FEE013: maybe with that or with that
[ 450.00- 458.80] MEE014: our data which could be decoded by the t v receiver which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever
[ 455.16- 455.48] MEO015: sorry
[ 459.92- 479.98] MEE014: whatever form of communication that the t v s are already using and since that that is another usin reason to use infrared because that is what all t v s use at the moment and then finally we want the to be available to a wide audience at a low cost
[ 480.00- 509.96] MEE014: so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that that should be good it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base as we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa
[ 482.80- 483.00] MEO015: right
[ 500.24- 500.90] FEE016: small
[ 501.04- 503.80] MEO015: ok i think right
[ 504.76- 506.32] FEE013: i think so
[ 506.60- 507.12] MEO015: ok
[ 510.00- 519.02] MEE014: thing that you could have i that was just sort of a general point there and that is yeah
[ 512.56- 514.16] MEO015: yeah i think you are right
[ 515.92- 523.58] FEE016: that is a very important point it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that whenever you would like me to present it
[ 516.72- 518.16] MEO015: yeah it is kind of
[ 521.72- 528.60] MEE014: alright ok and yeah that is that is what i came up with there so
[ 522.74- 523.56] FEE013: oh right
[ 523.26- 523.68] MEO015: ok
[ 524.76- 540.00] MEO015: yeah actually some of my points might overlap with what valem just mentioned but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting just took up a couple valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some
[ 540.00- 545.48] MEO015: missing loops in this thing which i think will take a feedback from the marketing because
[ 546.92- 563.00] MEO015: i have not had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t v to make make it as simple as possible and to summarize i would say it is it should be user friendly by being easy to use
[ 564.04- 570.00] MEO015: rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having
[ 570.00- 571.92] MEO015: a a remote control which has the main features
[ 573.16- 576.22] MEO015: like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever
[ 577.40- 600.00] MEO015: but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy will punch in these two u features together so what the concept is to have a flip top model the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to pro say program their favorite channels or whatever
[ 595.48- 596.80] MEE014: the function of that yeah
[ 600.00- 616.54] MEO015: can be put in the middle part of the flip top so it is like it could be accessed by a wider range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shockproof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people
[ 604.84- 607.60] FEE016: the plug has not come out yet the
[ 607.44- 611.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 609.04- 610.00] FEE016: ok
[ 618.26- 629.98] MEO015: findings most people prefer use user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have they have not used maybe thirty to forty percent of
[ 618.68- 619.08] MEE014: yeah
[ 630.00- 656.12] MEO015: buttons so it is no n of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of of a higher production like fifty million we said yeah with that i think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly
[ 657.62- 659.96] MEO015: that is so this is if you ask me first
[ 660.00- 662.12] MEO015: only i would make a
[ 664.48- 679.02] MEO015: flip top with a trendy design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons wh whether they are like soft or a little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous us usage and all that so in overall a simple and a
[ 680.84- 681.76] MEO015: user friendly design
[ 683.00- 684.68] MEO015: any comments like if you want
[ 685.52- 689.98] FEE013: i think we will chat about it at the end ok so if
[ 688.40- 689.36] MEO015: ok
[ 690.00- 694.32] FEE013: anyone wants to write something down anyone to put it at the end
[ 698.56- 700.92] FEE013: oh i have to put it on this that is right
[ 702.60- 703.36] FEE013: oh oh
[ 713.44- 714.48] MEO015: i think you have to
[ 715.44- 716.20] MEO015: you can not
[ 717.28- 719.52] MEO015: you will have to discuss it with
[ 719.60- 720.00] FEE013: yeah
[ 720.00- 721.04] FEE013: ok
[ 723.00- 724.24] MEO015: see you have to push it a bit more
[ 727.96- 728.24] MEO015: yep
[ 729.28- 730.28] MEO015: no that is not enough
[ 736.04- 736.36] MEE014: yeah
[ 737.04- 737.84] MEO015: oh ok
[ 744.36- 745.50] MEO015: yeah then you can pull it out now
[ 751.30- 751.96] FEE013: yeah
[ 753.76- 753.92] FEE013: ok
[ 754.90- 755.44] FEE013: ok
[ 762.28- 762.86] MEE014: yeah
[ 782.80- 783.20] FEE016: yeah
[ 782.92- 783.70] MEE014: yeah
[ 803.08- 806.52] FEE016: oh i got to keep this here
[ 808.76- 809.98] FEE016: i have to i have to move this
[ 810.00- 820.68] FEE016: and whoops ok i think a bit more
[ 826.60- 828.32] MEE014: ok a little bit more
[ 828.08- 828.82] FEE016: oh
[ 830.72- 830.98] MEE014: ok
[ 831.36- 832.34] FEE016: is that ok
[ 832.60- 832.74] MEO015: yeah
[ 836.80- 839.90] FEE016: thank you i will just put it a little closer a little bit
[ 840.08- 870.00] MEE014: we should be able to to to get the
[ 841.68- 843.88] FEE016: it is alright thank you
[ 845.64- 870.00] FEE016: ok i am going to look at the functional requirements from a marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research so that is where we started we used our our usability lab the company is usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public male and female all age groups from fifteen upwards and
[ 870.00- 876.28] FEE016: we observed them in the lab just their general use of the remote control you can see we had a hundred subjects there
[ 877.28- 895.60] FEE016: our findings lots of findings i have just summarized some of them here the overall thing which i have i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote control so that has obvious design implications there we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
[ 900.00- 927.84] FEE016: control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding but that is quite a high proportion of our our you know international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is a bit nicer looking current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall for example you can see below there seventy five percent of users zap a lot so you have got your person sub back in the sofa channel popping so again there is power implications there
[ 907.78- 907.96] MEO015: kay
[ 914.60- 916.30] FEE013: ok ok
[ 916.16- 916.52] MEO015: that is right
[ 918.68- 920.58] FEE013: right
[ 921.72- 924.86] FEE013: we have new project requirements
[ 930.00- 943.06] FEE016: users only use ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control
[ 931.12- 941.36] FEE013: we are not going to be using teletext pardon the consumer is considered outdated with the internet now
[ 934.20- 934.56] MEO015: ok
[ 942.40- 958.44] FEE013: our control is only going to be for t v it is not going to be a combined control which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer
[ 946.88- 960.00] FEE016: the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you p you mentioned earlier remote controls are often lost in the room as they are slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing fifty percent for
[ 960.00- 975.20] FEE016: were f particularly frustrated by that thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons they just can not be bothered to learn about the other functions
[ 960.56- 971.80] FEE013: it says for t v only so looks like it is just yeah i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
[ 974.24- 982.12] FEE013: i do not know what do you think it just said for t v only i mean general t v controls do do video as well
[ 976.06- 989.92] FEE016: slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury you know there is small movements so the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems the vast
[ 984.44- 988.88] FEE013: i mean you c well well it is not if you get con you get combined t v and videos do not you
[ 990.00-1019.96] FEE016: of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition again that was to aid i think in when they have lost the actual remote control some kind of speech recognition something we did not put to them but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until we find it or a flashing light possibly that trend reverses in the older age groups so thirty fives and unders who would like those two
[1002.44-1007.00] FEE013: i think we assume it has still got play and stop functions in the programming
[1005.24-1005.74] MEE014: ok
[1007.46-1013.88] MEO015: anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether the people want a combined something like that
[1009.02-1009.28] MEE014: yeah
[1020.00-1026.44] FEE016: features that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses they are not so bothered with this
[1027.48-1036.14] FEE016: i had marvelous tables and things that i could show you but i think i will just keep it simple if there is any more information i can email you with extra details is that ok
[1068.44-1070.20] FEE013: yeah
[1069.28-1071.00] MEE014: charls yeah yeah
[1073.64-1075.88] MEE014: i do not well i direct this or if you
[1076.84-1079.98] FEE016: so can we not program a video with this remote control
[1078.34-1079.96] MEE014: yeah if yeah and if you have got
[1080.00-1080.58] FEE016: ok
[1080.00-1092.32] MEE014: if you have got a sky box one of those sky plus boxes now you can record straight off the t v anywhere so on to on to like the t v hard drive or something
[1080.72-1097.84] FEE013: we do have a budget limitation that we can not control ourselves so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something a it needs to be the thing that you
[1084.46-1085.36] FEE016: just jump
[1097.26-1097.68] MEE014: yeah
[1097.68-1099.30] FEE016: we do not have long ideas
[1098.64-1109.96] FEE013: use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose you were saying whistling maybe o on the t v you could put like a pack on the t v or something so you can not see the remote you go and press the button on the
[1108.66-1109.92] FEE016: yes yes
[1110.00-1117.12] FEE013: top of the t v and it beeps ok it is over there something like that but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me
[1112.40-1112.88] MEO015: ok
[1116.24-1116.52] MEE014: yeah
[1118.00-1132.52] FEE013: the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset so we want logo we want
[1125.84-1126.52] FEE016: yeah
[1125.84-1136.32] MEE014: just as an idea on the speech recognition thing though pr it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they are not that great either
[1134.28-1139.98] FEE016: we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use
[1134.88-1138.56] FEE013: fashionable trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing
[1137.68-1138.44] MEE014: right
[1140.00-1143.72] FEE013: people paying more for it to look good
[1140.00-1156.70] FEE016: about ten percent of the buttons i think that that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things of on and off of the video fast forwarding so on and i think it is of general knowledge that people do find programming their video is a nightmare so i do not know if that is something we need to
[1144.90-1147.80] FEE013: we need to focus on that as well
[1146.60-1147.60] MEE014: alright yeah
[1152.76-1153.08] MEE014: yeah
[1153.90-1154.44] FEE013: yeah
[1158.62-1168.92] MEE014: yeah but on on that again i just thought cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i feel like
[1170.00-1189.00] FEE016: to both questions so we did not differentiate would you prefer an l c d screen that is multifunction remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control so you can see how the the yes now sort of varies across the age group there a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group i think that is just general fear of new technology
[1170.00-1170.68] MEE014: could be fun
[1179.76-1180.24] FEE013: yeah
[1180.20-1185.40] MEO015: so are we talking of a single model or maybe five six designs i do not know
[1186.28-1186.56] MEO015: sure
[1188.76-1189.00] MEO015: right
[1191.92-1192.16] MEO015: right
[1192.04-1193.40] MEE014: yeah yeah
[1193.52-1196.64] MEO015: the features could be same and the body could look spectacular
[1198.08-1198.60] MEO015: so
[1199.16-1199.98] FEE016: no
[1200.40-1214.68] FEE013: what about you were talking about the buttons the controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons not tiny little big rubber buttons but what about i mean cause we have got to make it original
[1202.16-1202.44] MEE014: yeah
[1203.04-1203.24] MEO015: yeah
[1204.92-1207.14] MEE014: that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me
[1216.20-1217.36] FEE013: what about
[1218.68-1222.00] FEE013: you know with the touch screen computers
[1223.34-1230.00] FEE013: yeah so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which
[1230.00-1233.92] FEE013: should not wear out as much either not sure about the
[1232.06-1232.54] FEE016: yeah
[1233.66-1234.68] FEE016: something like that
[1235.16-1250.72] FEE013: you do not have to press it you just have to put your thumb onto it think that might appeal i am thinking kind of japan thinking young office people trendy kind of thing
[1237.48-1237.96] FEE016: yeah
[1252.08-1260.00] FEE013: but quite easily labeled so that anyone can do oh yeah that is obvious what
[1260.00-1265.60] FEE013: that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations
[1264.12-1265.04] MEE014: yeah
[1267.36-1289.96] FEE016: well further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is it is going to be different for a fifteen year old for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i do not know if you get the idea it is it is going to vary around the world at the end of the day the the end
[1274.36-1284.28] MEO015: yeah maybe to as it it was indicated the risk of a repeated use the injuries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that
[1276.30-1282.04] MEE014: well yeah you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same
[1282.84-1283.56] FEE013: too big
[1283.28-1287.16] MEE014: just yeah
[1286.72-1289.96] MEO015: so a bigger b ok so you you are dividing designs
[1290.00-1299.68] FEE016: generating design is one thing it is the user interface design that may and that the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets around the world
[1290.00-1302.86] MEO015: these do not not any segment age groups here design are dividing it according to the countries also the market maybe for u s and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and if in japan and all you m need to have small yeah
[1305.28-1305.94] MEE014: kay
[1310.68-1314.62] MEE014: yeah yeah that is what mine is just yeah
[1322.88-1326.20] MEE014: no well no cause you would not have to you do not have to press it just
[1327.52-1327.84] MEE014: yeah
[1332.56-1345.40] FEE013: i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller or they can make it bigger or they can change the feature slightly
[1339.72-1340.16] MEE014: yeah
[1350.00-1357.14] FEE013: so i am just one thing and not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities
[1354.08-1375.72] MEE014: but also ergonomics as we are saying of the different designs ergonomics there is sort of physically different things cause if you have ever seen the x box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the control wheel was physically too big because
[1366.52-1368.18] FEE016: office people
[1370.02-1372.48] FEE016: yeah i think
[1376.92-1380.00] MEE014: they are cut just generally japanese people have
[1380.00-1393.76] MEE014: smaller hands so they can get around the controller which is so if you i do not know what cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something than small ones for others
[1380.32-1380.86] FEE016: yeah
[1383.36-1384.96] FEE016: yeah
[1387.52-1389.40] MEO015: we could focus on the biggest market
[1390.40-1393.64] MEO015: we could say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market
[1392.88-1399.74] FEE013: or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive i think that is the only way that you can avoid
[1400.84-1401.76] FEE013: that kind of issue
[1403.92-1405.72] MEE014: yeah yeah
[1419.04-1419.44] MEE014: yeah
[1422.20-1422.96] MEE014: yeah
[1426.00-1426.56] MEE014: yeah
[1427.52-1430.02] FEE013: we are we are talking about
[1431.68-1432.16] MEE014: yeah
[1432.04-1440.00] FEE013: the type of company that we are working for as well that they want it to be fashionable they want it to be trendy and you would not
[1440.00-1459.84] FEE013: automatically assume associate that with the older generations now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a greater population than us young people but i do not think we are focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of mid range
[1441.32-1441.68] MEE014: yeah
[1445.72-1446.04] FEE016: ok
[1461.24-1463.60] FEE013: business kind of class type people
[1461.40-1462.00] MEE014: yeah
[1463.76-1464.12] FEE016: ok
[1465.28-1469.48] FEE016: the internal design has got to make the same
[1468.24-1468.64] MEE014: yeah
[1471.32-1471.64] FEE016: no
[1471.92-1483.04] MEE014: i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel it becomes you know
[1477.52-1494.84] FEE016: i am concerned when you raise the the r a s i issue again repetitive strain injury i do not think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough i think that is still a kind of question or issue how we deal with that r a s i tends to be caused by repetitive small movements
[1484.24-1487.24] MEE014: yeah and speech recognition yeah
[1484.72-1496.12] FEE013: ok so the remote control functions we have got the t v we have got the video now there is
[1496.08-1500.00] FEE016: i would i really can not get my head around this one this may have to be postponed to our future meeting
[1497.50-1500.00] FEE013: i can not remember what it is called the little code at the end
[1500.00-1503.92] FEE013: of program details yes
[1500.00-1501.80] FEE016: it is something we should think about
[1505.80-1517.56] FEE013: we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it
[1510.22-1511.44] MEE014: yeah ok
[1510.52-1513.24] FEE016: i know and it becomes a ridiculous or s
[1514.44-1514.64] FEE016: it is
[1517.24-1517.82] FEE016: i think that is it
[1518.84-1529.96] FEE013: because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a program on you want to put record on that is fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not sure if you are going to you
[1519.64-1520.02] FEE016: yeah
[1522.08-1528.76] FEE016: do we have to initially you know looking at the findings here focus on
[1530.00-1538.76] FEE013: put the number in and it is just a number it is not a date it is not time it is not a channel it is not when it finishes it is not anything like that it is just a number
[1530.20-1538.02] FEE016: younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later do we really have to go for everyone right away
[1541.96-1542.36] MEE014: yeah
[1542.48-1542.88] FEE013: yeah
[1542.64-1547.88] FEE016: and when we was drawing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people young people trying to be people
[1544.24-1546.40] FEE013: you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway
[1549.40-1560.00] FEE013: it is after if you look in the newspaper or t v guide or any t v guide there is a five six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and
[1560.00-1574.56] FEE013: it is recorded that it is going to be on on tuesdays at ten o clock on the seventeenths things like that so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times and it has been around for quite a long time
[1577.12-1582.64] FEE013: no it is not but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
[1582.60-1590.00] FEE016: i am just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage we want to you know not
[1590.00-1593.36] FEE016: waste money not be profligate and
[1592.40-1593.50] MEE014: video plus
[1595.36-1602.76] FEE016: in a focus on where the idea will be taken up first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this
[1601.96-1603.14] MEE014: yeah
[1602.20-1602.96] FEE013: ok so
[1617.82-1619.12] MEE014: it is watching
[1623.96-1633.28] MEO015: right i think it is not too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street but for a remote he will just report to the manager another time
[1626.88-1635.56] MEE014: and you would yeah and you would not you would not need a a whole host of extra buttons for that you just need one cause you have already got them done so you would
[1635.40-1635.60] FEE016: yeah
[1637.52-1637.88] MEO015: simple
[1641.88-1642.46] MEE014: ok
[1645.92-1646.40] MEE014: yeah
[1663.48-1669.12] MEE014: it is been been around for a long time it is just it is not very well advertised it is it is hard to use it
[1665.68-1670.40] FEE016: i am not coming across that function but it sounds wonderful
[1672.08-1680.00] MEE014: though if you if you have got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the program one
[1674.44-1680.00] FEE013: the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there you are pressing this button and your t v is not doing it
[1679.60-1679.96] FEE016: oh
[1680.00-1680.40] FEE013: it
[1680.00-1684.56] MEE014: so it will record that program when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series
[1681.24-1685.92] FEE013: taking your t v and your control and saying look this is what i am doing it is not working what should i do
[1686.08-1692.04] MEE014: so that yeah but just have that s function would be would be really good
[1690.16-1690.56] FEE016: ok
[1693.66-1696.02] FEE013: i think so just a thought
[1698.08-1698.60] FEE016: yeah
[1698.28-1710.00] FEE013: instruction manuals but i mean there there is customer service there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is
[1702.52-1703.16] FEE016: yeah
[1710.00-1716.34] FEE013: no call out charge there is no extra the person has to walk to a shop on the high street
[1711.48-1712.20] FEE016: right
[1712.54-1716.16] MEO015: so are we talking of the concept of a rechargeable something or something
[1714.60-1716.36] FEE016: excellent
[1717.48-1717.84] MEE014: yeah
[1720.72-1721.28] FEE016: right
[1723.20-1739.98] FEE016: can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me we already produce our own mobile phones that that is kind of what led us on to comparing t v remote controls with the sort of design features
[1724.08-1739.96] FEE013: but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little variety and lots and lots of pages it does you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it so that should be something we think of
[1740.00-1759.22] FEE013: about what other functions we need i am not sure if we need a design decision now but we should think about c cause you have got the dilemma between oh batteries that is what i was thinking about what about phone batteries what kind of battery is that
[1740.00-1769.12] FEE016: and chain companies like carphone warehouse you can pop in any time with a phone that you bought for them if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it they will phone the company you can use their telephones is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets you know which button is it i press for this that is a free that is a free aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to them
[1740.00-1764.40] MEE014: but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who who you deal with have actually they have they have got an obligation to to help you out and also i mean it is it is fair enough to have some sort of help service but i i am not sure how much the cost would be i think
[1768.56-1770.00] FEE013: well they li they they last
[1770.00-1790.04] FEE013: last quite a long time and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or at night or something but it does not really matter cause it never really runs out cause it lasts a long time once it is charged something like that should reduce the size of it
[1772.82-1795.88] MEO015: what i was thinking of a design which nokia came up with almost six or seven years back basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box like a chocolate that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they come up with something like this curved up so here and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much so it is like a you can say a banana chip kind of thing curved up like a boat
[1783.44-1784.12] MEE014: yeah i mean
[1786.40-1790.14] MEE014: i mean instruct instruction books like the other thing
[1793.20-1796.46] MEE014: yeah yeah
[1793.80-1794.40] FEE016: right
[1797.44-1799.98] MEO015: so what happens is you do not have to
[1798.20-1800.00] FEE013: yeah it could be on that yeah
[1800.00-1801.08] FEE013: s ok
[1800.00-1801.68] MEO015: press your thumb too down like
[1800.72-1801.16] FEE016: alright
[1802.48-1808.80] MEO015: so it is already curved up so your thumb does not yeah so we can have a s like you know mold it according to your
[1802.52-1802.84] FEE013: s
[1802.52-1803.56] FEE016: your control is safe
[1806.04-1816.20] FEE016: if it was something as simple as you could not change a channel but i mean for if there were any more or were we absolutely definite it is only going to be for t v and video ok just a thought
[1806.12-1806.64] FEE013: yes
[1807.72-1809.44] FEE013: rechargeable with a docking station
[1809.56-1810.00] MEE014: yeah
[1809.96-1813.60] MEO015: the way you hold of it is kind of semi circular in the bottom so kind of like
[1810.72-1812.60] FEE013: so the rechargeable would sh would be your
[1812.28-1815.12] MEE014: yeah yeah play should be yeah
[1814.04-1814.36] FEE013: fail
[1814.82-1817.46] MEO015: i want to say exactly semi circular but yeah
[1816.12-1816.68] FEE013: ok
[1819.52-1830.00] FEE013: yes which is cheaper than the other one as well the c the shape you got trendy i f do not want a big box with lots of
[1819.52-1820.00] FEE016: ok
[1820.92-1821.66] MEE014: yeah
[1828.42-1829.00] FEE016: sure
[1830.00-1842.44] FEE013: things you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either because then you have got the repetitive stringing and it will matter how many how much you try and make it simple
[1830.44-1831.24] MEO015: put it
[1832.92-1833.32] FEE016: yeah
[1834.92-1835.16] FEE016: yeah
[1841.90-1845.52] FEE016: not with such simple functions because we are focusing on that yeah
[1846.08-1846.76] FEE013: they do
[1849.56-1859.70] MEE014: and they are they are specially made for the for the mobile phones but they come with a charger i mean you could you could bundle a charger
[1853.36-1855.86] FEE016: it is people love reading them too it must be an obvious thing
[1857.16-1858.76] FEE013: ok so we have got a flip screen
[1857.28-1858.32] MEO015: we could look at that but
[1858.40-1859.92] FEE016: sure that should be something with
[1860.00-1862.74] MEO015: what we were talking is to make it more
[1864.10-1873.68] MEO015: rather than like seashells logo could become means you could put a logo in the corner of the the model rather than you know trying to make it like a seashell or what do you tell me
[1867.24-1867.88] MEE014: yeah
[1870.46-1870.84] MEE014: yeah
[1874.96-1875.32] MEE014: yeah
[1879.08-1887.28] MEE014: yeah and it is yeah if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the blu framer and that could
[1880.24-1880.96] MEO015: a seashell
[1885.98-1886.52] FEE013: ok
[1889.28-1890.00] MEE014: yeah i might
[1890.00-1890.56] MEE014: as well so
[1893.80-1895.64] FEE013: cause it is kind of logged into your hand anyway
[1895.52-1899.72] MEE014: yeah some sort of docking station or yeah
[1900.56-1901.72] MEO015: yeah we can do that
[1903.38-1909.64] MEE014: yeah yeah that is yeah that that would be fine and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time
[1904.00-1904.52] FEE013: ok
[1906.40-1910.26] FEE013: can you look into the company logo
[1911.40-1911.76] MEE014: yeah
[1911.50-1920.00] FEE013: things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product
[1920.00-1921.32] FEE013: i mean
[1923.22-1938.74] FEE013: for example if it was a c or something like that you could have it in a vague c shape that opens up kind of like a shell or something something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
[1936.24-1936.56] MEE014: yeah
[1940.40-1946.44] FEE013: obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that is there
[1944.54-1948.90] MEO015: yeah maybe we could come up with some s five six s designs and then choose which are which are appeals to like the
[1948.92-1950.00] MEO015: yeah
[1950.00-1951.64] MEO015: like that could be the most common design
[1952.84-1954.60] MEO015: we can like think of five six reasons
[1961.52-1962.52] MEE014: yeah
[1962.60-1977.64] FEE016: and we do not want i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical these little brown things with the same colored buttons all crowned in on the s the surface we definitely an o an obvious thing a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles we do not want that
[1963.40-1966.00] FEE013: well we need to think about how it is going to look different
[1965.08-1965.32] MEO015: yeah
[1975.12-1975.82] MEE014: yeah
[1989.84-1990.14] MEE014: yeah
[2001.64-2010.00] FEE013: oh you could do different like you get with mobile phones different fashions you could have different kind of
[2003.80-2005.52] FEE016: ok
[2010.00-2018.40] FEE013: casings so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
[2022.98-2023.60] FEE013: yeah
[2038.76-2039.24] FEE013: yeah
[2038.82-2039.80] MEO015: yeah
[2040.36-2040.84] FEE013: ok
[2042.52-2042.92] FEE013: ok
[2042.76-2043.08] MEO015: yeah
[2044.98-2047.48] FEE013: right i think we have to round it up
[2048.84-2049.24] FEE013: sure
[2055.44-2057.72] MEO015: for the machine right
[2062.36-2068.92] FEE013: that was in cutting down the number that was kind of separate that was cutting down the number of functions
[2065.60-2066.08] MEE014: yeah
[2067.80-2069.24] FEE016: right
[2070.28-2070.74] FEE013: right
[2071.40-2075.84] FEE013: so instead of having lots of things to put in for date
[2080.30-2081.40] MEO015: yep
[2086.96-2095.92] FEE013: what is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that it could be it
[2087.04-2100.00] FEE016: i think that is that sounds a really attractive idea i have not come across anything like that before if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip top then it is nice to oh you can make it lightweight plastic nice to hold in the palm of the hand
[2096.56-2099.96] FEE013: i yes it could be a advert a vertice
[2100.00-2106.02] FEE013: mint feature rather than design feature you know draw attention to that
[2100.00-2121.20] FEE016: and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers that is going to take care of some of the pedidot strain injury trying to prevent a lot of it i would think i think it is a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we are using plastic you can still i mean think of the design you can get in plastic you can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior
[2106.72-2115.56] FEE013: and also paid lip service in the instruction manual cause it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
[2113.04-2114.12] MEO015: oops question four
[2115.60-2116.80] MEO015: ok time for us to
[2117.12-2117.42] FEE013: yeah
[2119.28-2119.80] MEO015: good point
[2120.04-2120.40] FEE013: yeah
[2127.80-2128.24] FEE016: yeah
[2129.64-2129.96] FEE013: we have
[2130.00-2136.76] FEE013: up the buttons but i think we will work through that with the design of it
[2130.72-2131.08] FEE016: yeah
[2133.20-2133.58] FEE016: yeah
[2138.32-2154.84] FEE016: there is chance of it being lost too it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the south of us people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ca if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they do not they are not going to lose it so much otherwise it is it is easy to put nice to handle
[2139.28-2140.84] FEE013: yes yes
[2142.00-2148.44] FEE013: and we have talked about there being an alarm or something a beeper for being lost
[2150.04-2160.00] FEE013: learning how to use it should be as simple as possible but there are not going to be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction that
[2156.72-2157.00] MEE014: yeah
[2160.00-2163.84] FEE013: well i do not know if we deal with that
[2162.00-2162.64] FEE016: ok
[2165.94-2166.44] FEE013: i think
[2168.00-2181.32] FEE016: can i just quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything so it is no teletext it is only for t v and by implication video corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control something about video plus
[2169.84-2174.12] FEE013: yeah and different from what is i do yeah i think that is us
[2180.12-2183.76] FEE013: i th think you might get guidance but
[2185.48-2185.64] FEE013: i
[2187.16-2189.76] FEE013: instruction manuals cause there tends to be a
[2190.20-2190.92] FEE016: right
[2191.60-2198.52] FEE013: demonize the thing they are everyone has got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them
[2194.12-2200.88] FEE016: right so when they predict the programming you that comes up on the l c d a reminder about using video plus so that they will look at the guide and
[2202.30-2206.66] FEE016: or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that was an add on feature
[2204.12-2205.98] FEE013: yes right ok
[2205.44-2206.32] MEE014: yeah
[2210.88-2211.48] FEE013: ok
[2211.56-2211.96] FEE016: ok
[2213.44-2217.40] FEE013: i think you can email me if there is any more questions
[2213.46-2218.08] FEE016: right so it is doing away with the programming feature and
[2220.00-2221.96] FEE013: i know i will be able to not answer that
[2235.16-2241.92] FEE016: oh and the rechargeable batteries was there anything else there that we that would not project requirements
[2235.26-2235.56] MEE014: ok
[2255.76-2263.12] FEE016: yeah that is not at the moment a requirement it is something we are looking at on the preference that we come around to market research at some point to sort of
[2292.20-2292.72] FEE016: ok
[2294.56-2300.04] FEE016: what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting or shall i just sort of generally look at all these two
[2308.52-2308.84] FEE016: cause you are
[2318.56-2319.16] FEE016: ok
[2322.72-2324.24] FEE016: it is a discussion
[2325.30-2326.98] FEE016: cause we have lost time for us two

============================================================
SESSION: ES2004c
============================================================

[   0.00-   2.00] FEE013: i will wait until you are all round do you think so
[  17.56-  19.12] FEE016: ok
[  22.84-  23.20] FEE016: oh
[  29.76-  30.00] FEE013: ok
[  30.00-  30.24] FEE013: yeah
[  50.12-  50.56] FEE016: oh
[  52.40-  54.74] FEE013: ok
[  54.24-  54.44] MEO015: ok
[  78.08-  78.56] FEE013: ok
[  80.08-  83.88] FEE013: welcome back everybody people had fun
[  82.48-  83.26] MEO015: fresh
[  85.12-  85.36] MEO015: ok
[  85.44-  89.98] FEE013: right this is our conceptual design meeting
[  90.00-  93.52] FEE013: i think we are slightly ahead of ourselves
[  94.76-  99.68] FEE013: from the last meeting i th i think yeah
[  96.00-  98.26] MEE014: yeah yeah let us get an idea of the question as well
[ 101.04- 111.60] FEE013: this is where we talk about properties materials user interface and trend watching
[ 109.84- 110.40] MEE014: sounds
[ 112.68- 115.00] FEE013: so i think we have touched on a few things
[ 116.64- 118.92] FEE013: two of that already but we will just go over it
[ 122.98- 143.34] FEE013: the minutes from last time we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext it was not going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
[ 150.00- 165.40] FEE013: recognition we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just a different shape from what is normal
[ 168.96- 172.12] FEE013: you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
[ 172.32- 172.64] MEE014: yeah
[ 173.32- 179.98] FEE013: and we were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost and things like that
[ 177.68- 178.08] MEE014: yeah
[ 180.00- 192.80] FEE013: and our market was going to be young business kind of range ok so shall we start with the first presentation yes if you feel
[ 188.08- 188.36] MEO015: kay
[ 191.24- 194.52] FEE016: just connect up
[ 191.78- 192.16] MEO015: yeah
[ 201.08- 201.44] FEE016: thank you
[ 217.92- 228.52] FEE016: ok ok so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching
[ 229.80- 232.38] FEE016: the methods we use to decide on
[ 234.60- 239.98] FEE016: current trends and so on market trends or that we did our traditional our our usual market research study
[ 240.00- 249.58] FEE016: with our hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most it w i am sorry i am slightly tongue tied after lunch sorry
[ 249.46- 250.60] FEE013: it is
[ 251.16- 269.08] FEE016: we decided on the most important aspect required in a remote control device and we will come to that later so that was one of the first things we did also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion design in paris and the land
[ 270.28- 289.54] FEE016: so the general findings from that was in market trends the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls they als also want a remote control to be technologically innovative
[ 290.90- 299.84] FEE016: and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important it is
[ 300.00- 306.40] FEE016: twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
[ 307.84- 329.96] FEE016: so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third it is still important but it is third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at ok now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group we found from our consultants in paris and milan who d attended all the design and fashion
[ 316.02- 316.32] FEE013: yeah
[ 330.00- 339.14] FEE016: here is then that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture so should we be thinking of using something like that in a remote control design too
[ 340.14- 356.54] FEE016: there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people in paris in the land it would be interesting to see what our design people make of that
[ 356.92- 357.16] MEO015: ok
[ 357.28- 359.98] FEE013: ok thank you very much
[ 360.68- 360.82] MEO015: yeah
[ 361.48- 363.92] FEE013: let us start from the inside and work our way out
[ 363.56- 365.00] MEO015: right ok
[ 364.28- 365.84] MEE014: yeah ok
[ 365.44- 369.44] FEE016: i am not sure if anyone has any questions about that not yet
[ 367.56- 369.48] FEE013: yeah d take a second ok
[ 371.04- 373.08] FEE013: yes thank you
[ 380.96- 383.52] MEE014: let us see
[ 381.16- 381.76] FEE016: s
[ 388.56- 389.72] FEE013: i hate those little things
[ 390.00- 390.28] MEE014: yeah
[ 390.96- 395.96] FEE013: especially if you do them on too tight and you can not get the leverage on them to undo them
[ 395.42- 395.92] FEE016: yeah
[ 403.02- 404.54] MEE014: yeah
[ 410.80- 411.24] FEE013: ok
[ 410.84- 419.96] MEE014: ok this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the
[ 420.00- 425.00] MEE014: moment ok first the
[ 426.20- 449.98] MEE014: into the method the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t v and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n unfortunately are
[ 450.00- 450.56] MEE014: available
[ 451.06- 451.40] FEE013: kay
[ 452.68- 478.52] MEE014: findings i have got my nice little picture there this is the chip called the t a double one eight three five which is what is used in pretty much every remote control cause it sends out standard signals based on your input and it is pretty much used for all all t v remotes at the moment and then we we are lo looking into battery options
[ 472.20- 472.32] FEE013: yeah
[ 480.00- 506.64] MEE014: is actually no rechargeable option available so we i saw the the standard double a and triple a which we thought were a bit a bit too bulky at the moment dynamo charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest people want it is it is basically like wind up radio so you wind up your remote control before you use it what
[ 497.46- 498.88] FEE013: can you explain that
[ 500.12- 502.60] FEE013: so things right ok
[ 502.32- 505.72] FEE016: does he like charges as someone like this i am not too sure
[ 504.94- 510.00] FEE013: how what kind of how long can you get out of that i mean can you pick it up and then what
[ 509.16- 510.00] FEE016: it has to be similar
[ 510.00- 512.54] FEE013: wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night or
[ 510.56- 522.16] MEO015: regarding the sizes which one you think will be like because we we have to take into consideration size also so maybe it is standard triple m might take less space and dynamo might take more space
[ 512.16- 533.16] MEE014: yeah yeah oh yeah i presume you would not have to wind it for very long but i do not i do not think it is really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options like the the solar charging cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you have got t v
[ 530.32- 530.68] FEE016: yeah
[ 531.46- 533.00] FEE013: that is the count that does not matter
[ 531.90- 533.04] FEE016: what is the issue with
[ 533.80- 537.80] FEE013: i thought it was q should be like that
[ 535.20- 535.52] MEE014: no
[ 535.26- 536.00] FEE016: that is good to know
[ 536.88- 539.12] MEE014: is it oh right is
[ 539.60- 540.00] FEE013: yeah
[ 540.00- 540.84] FEE013: in
[ 541.16- 545.32] FEE016: oh yeah different marketing market for different marketing internationally
[ 541.56- 541.74] MEO015: yeah
[ 545.72- 545.92] MEO015: yeah
[ 549.56- 550.20] MEO015: no
[ 551.04- 557.24] MEE014: yeah it would the the yeah the dynamo would take more space cause you would actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up
[ 557.00- 559.68] FEE013: i am pretty sure that solar is from the sun
[ 559.76- 560.84] MEE014: yeah ok
[ 560.52- 569.96] FEE013: i do not think it counts electric lights no but i mean not many you do not want to limit your market i mean people who live in basement plants they do not
[ 570.00- 573.00] FEE013: not that many people but there are people
[ 571.72- 571.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 575.12- 580.40] MEE014: yeah and most people most people also watch t v in the in the night anyway
[ 578.52- 583.52] MEO015: and are these like what is the life of the kinetic battery it like it runs for a long time
[ 580.60- 588.72] FEE013: but then it would be charging through the day i think the point is it charges through the day and then you have got it charged i think now
[ 587.24- 599.98] MEE014: but i i think i think the the next one is the best anyway the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in ri you get it in wrist watches and you you do not even notice it i mean the amount the amount
[ 590.12- 590.60] FEE013: ok
[ 595.40- 596.24] FEE013: yeah i see
[ 597.88- 598.28] MEO015: ok
[ 600.00- 608.06] MEE014: probably moving around you would be doing all the time would would charge it up i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaping it up to make it work
[ 600.58- 602.04] MEO015: pursuing the normal back
[ 613.52- 629.98] MEE014: yeah it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery cause they use them quite frequently in watches and that will that
[ 621.64- 629.98] FEE016: so it is not the draw on it is it ok i just got one referring back to solar charging is that compatible with
[ 630.00- 637.28] FEE016: you mean standard batteries i mean could people put standard batteries in but with the s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charge and whether two things are not compatible
[ 630.00- 640.40] MEE014: word would last for well i do not i d i am not entirely sure how long it would last but i have never seen one run out well
[ 640.00- 657.18] FEE013: but then if you think about a watch it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around you are doing things it is moving a lot of the time if you would i mean you switch the t v on then you put it on the side then you pick it out to change it then you put it on the side is it really going to be enough
[ 645.08- 645.52] MEE014: yeah
[ 647.24- 654.60] MEO015: another question is like sorry w which one would last the longest because we do not want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day
[ 649.90- 651.28] MEE014: yeah and
[ 654.48- 656.48] FEE016: that affects the h d l design
[ 655.38- 659.98] MEE014: yeah but then again i i think it is because if you think about it the
[ 655.96- 659.34] MEO015: or remote control like so we can just look at the light also
[ 660.00- 686.72] MEE014: watch although it is only a tiny amount it is it is it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out overnight when you leave them on the side and the the same the same reason you are only using it for a incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it which you put it no no i do not i do not think the gerontom would be
[ 672.44- 672.92] FEE013: ok
[ 681.76- 683.44] FEE013: so it is enough to draw on it is not it
[ 684.92- 685.40] FEE013: ok
[ 686.96- 687.28] MEO015: ok
[ 695.84- 715.00] MEE014: yeah yeah i think i it c you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because if you like in on a calculator they they are quite they are quite big and they are all they all look identical
[ 698.24- 699.60] FEE013: a cajou
[ 704.48- 705.04] FEE016: yeah
[ 707.36- 707.98] FEE016: and the question is
[ 716.16- 719.98] FEE013: expensive as well what kind of price are we looking at for
[ 717.12- 717.28] FEE016: yeah
[ 717.24- 719.00] MEE014: they are they are expensive they do not
[ 720.00- 723.08] FEE013: i presume that normal batteries are the cheapest
[ 723.00- 731.28] MEE014: yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i presume that then it would actually be the the solar charging ones but the
[ 732.44- 748.50] MEE014: it is it i think they are not very resistant to dropping cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have the size you would need to charge a remote it would not be that big but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff so
[ 736.48- 741.60] FEE016: it would just attract from the attractiveness of the other little feature but it would not have anything out there
[ 738.32- 738.96] FEE013: so
[ 740.28- 741.44] FEE013: so they are not designed to
[ 745.26- 745.64] MEO015: ok
[ 750.00- 751.56] FEE013: practical wise ok
[ 750.00- 751.88] MEE014: i think yeah practically
[ 752.32- 758.56] FEE016: should not we do some more research on that first before we add it in because i i personally do not think about it right ok
[ 753.64- 760.56] MEE014: i mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do they can take
[ 759.14- 763.08] FEE013: do you get a bit of work but do you calculate just have a battery in your web
[ 762.36- 766.96] MEE014: yeah they do they yeah they have got dual things but they are the batteries are smaller i think
[ 774.96- 778.24] MEE014: yeah so the
[ 779.64- 780.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 780.00- 784.80] MEE014: the this if you if you had something ju using the standard
[ 786.00- 797.82] MEE014: batteries and the solar charging i do not think you would i think the it would well you know how long the standard double a s would last in or triple a s would last
[ 797.16- 803.68] FEE016: it is not something that has come up in any of our focus groups in market research it is not a thing that people are looking for
[ 799.30- 801.96] MEE014: yeah i think it i think it would yeah
[ 801.88- 806.28] FEE013: ok can we add in an attachment to clothing feature
[ 804.84- 806.44] FEE016: and we still open to the field yeah
[ 807.98- 810.00] FEE013: can we think about that cause it is
[ 808.04- 809.96] FEE016: but it is something to put on the side to think about the
[ 810.00- 814.20] FEE013: we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
[ 811.76- 812.24] MEE014: yeah
[ 816.28- 819.14] FEE013: we will add it in to think about
[ 821.88- 822.56] FEE013: because
[ 823.68- 839.98] FEE013: where am i if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do kind of we are doing something original and different
[ 832.64- 833.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 840.00- 848.16] FEE013: but if you wore it if it is on you could just click one in your pocket then you would have that less you you would not lose it that much
[ 847.24- 847.64] MEE014: yes
[ 849.52- 852.72] FEE013: but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than
[ 849.86- 850.14] MEE014: yeah
[ 854.12- 856.60] FEE013: the eternal battle for control of the controls
[ 861.80- 862.36] FEE013: just now
[ 864.04- 864.52] FEE013: ok
[ 868.00- 868.48] MEO015: yeah
[ 868.04- 868.50] MEE014: ok
[ 871.64- 872.36] FEE013: ok right
[ 872.20- 873.28] MEE014: ok well i will move on
[ 874.84- 900.00] MEE014: my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicon p c v board which print printed circuit board which basically has these contacts they are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button it will connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to to
[ 884.88- 885.46] MEO015: kay
[ 900.00- 917.68] MEE014: two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l e d in a sequence of on and off bursts
[ 918.16- 928.04] FEE013: what kind of things do we have to consider though can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
[ 925.26- 930.00] MEE014: well well the the thi the thing about it is
[ 931.58- 959.90] MEE014: the they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because can can print circuit board like that the it is it is simply spaced like that so can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in if if see how thin the tracks are could could s could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if if wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that or
[ 952.22- 952.62] FEE013: ok
[ 960.00- 962.16] MEE014: have some sort of
[ 963.60- 967.48] MEE014: array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that
[ 966.52- 966.92] FEE013: ok
[ 969.08- 989.98] MEE014: and then to yeah so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a stand by an open up while not being used and what i was thinking about that was cause sometimes when when you have these things they have got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone we do it more often than i have
[ 986.72- 987.08] FEE016: yeah
[ 990.00-1003.04] MEE014: than on a t v remote but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up
[ 991.24-1008.58] MEO015: second question yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the color call it a skin or whatever so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the color like from green parrot green to chilly red or something like that so is that feature available in like titanium or it is like only specific to plastic
[1004.92-1019.96] MEE014: the case material i have been sent what the factory can actually give us the there is the plastic which i think we were going to go for anyway has the
[1020.00-1023.28] MEE014: main case case housing and
[1024.60-1049.96] MEE014: the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber well you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps
[1050.00-1056.50] MEE014: something made of rubber but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they have they have said
[1050.00-1050.20] MEO015: yeah
[1056.08-1056.80] MEO015: yeah ok
[1057.88-1060.24] MEE014: that they have they have put across
[1058.64-1060.68] MEO015: right that could be a good idea
[1061.52-1079.98] MEE014: are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r s i i am not i am not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said
[1061.92-1063.96] MEO015: it could it could be comfortable to hold on it so
[1072.20-1072.28] FEE016: yeah
[1080.00-1084.84] MEE014: the problem with the casing is that there is
[1086.08-1109.20] MEE014: quite there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes but whether whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
[1092.12-1109.80] FEE016: it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall i have got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily when i drop it i was just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that could give the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different pressure in the back
[1111.36-1112.42] MEE014: for the flip plane
[1111.48-1112.76] FEE013: so the flip side
[1114.30-1116.00] FEE016: it is a rubber c rubber s yeah
[1116.00-1116.36] MEE014: yeah
[1118.52-1118.92] FEE016: yeah
[1123.20-1123.84] MEE014: yeah i th
[1124.64-1128.36] FEE016: very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one for that
[1128.24-1140.00] MEE014: yeah in in titanium i do not i do not think it would be available at all really the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy an
[1130.60-1133.08] MEO015: so i did not get the last part you took that
[1131.84-1133.20] FEE016: i do not see why not
[1135.64-1139.32] MEO015: just what you said i i did not get the meaning of it completely you are saying
[1140.00-1151.00] MEE014: new case for it because of the expense of how much titanium is it is it is light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a
[1141.18-1141.48] MEO015: ok
[1148.10-1148.44] MEO015: ok
[1152.44-1153.12] MEE014: for a remote
[1156.72-1158.50] MEE014: yeah yeah
[1163.88-1165.12] MEE014: rubber yeah
[1168.64-1170.00] MEE014: and you can peel them off yeah
[1169.96-1170.00] FEE013: yeah
[1170.00-1180.84] FEE013: so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber like those pens that you get with the grip that you can you can pull that off
[1176.04-1176.74] MEE014: yeah ok
[1178.32-1178.68] MEE014: yeah
[1182.08-1182.52] FEE013: ok
[1184.76-1184.92] MEE014: yeah
[1187.76-1188.24] MEE014: yeah
[1188.72-1192.64] FEE013: well that has been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not
[1193.72-1199.98] MEE014: also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons the
[1195.06-1195.48] FEE013: kay
[1200.00-1219.60] MEE014: i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen f now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p c b circuit board and i am sure you could probably get it in different colors and so you just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection
[1220.72-1229.96] MEE014: over if you had them close enough that would be one option the second option they offer rubber buttons but i thought that an l
[1221.44-1221.72] FEE016: so
[1225.14-1230.00] FEE016: i do not sorry to interrupt i do not see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example have
[1229.88-1230.00] MEO015: it
[1230.00-1234.30] FEE016: the show or it would be flat in size things yeah
[1230.00-1249.58] MEE014: c d type of screen cause one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space two they you can have them in a sort of a range you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of sat thing you could have them like a touch
[1230.00-1247.40] MEO015: yeah it has to be interesting cause somebody who sells very often a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often he will find it very irritating to use you know and he might spoil the touch pad very fast compared to a button like if you keep punching with and point over to
[1235.96-1237.08] FEE016: and it is not a stage
[1250.92-1251.54] MEE014: display
[1251.88-1252.08] FEE016: yes
[1254.32-1255.52] MEE014: what what
[1259.12-1259.96] MEE014: oh on the on the
[1260.00-1278.28] MEE014: the l c d screen you could you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it is flat and so you can not do lots of curve curve things with it but you can you would not have with the l c d you would have the wires coming off you would not have that with the
[1260.42-1273.04] MEO015: there is even small section before like you are this thing regarding the circuit since we are having a having a clipped top we can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons in the these things so we can divide the circuit like you know
[1261.04-1261.36] FEE016: yeah
[1269.78-1285.40] FEE016: i would say another idea i do not know if it helps with that but just to do with the r s i is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing that you can use to look for your power button
[1279.40-1282.12] MEE014: with the l c d you would only have that with the printed circuit board
[1283.20-1283.72] MEE014: with
[1283.90-1284.16] MEO015: ok
[1285.04-1286.50] MEE014: also with the
[1289.52-1290.00] FEE016: yeah
[1290.00-1292.32] FEE016: so it is easy to replace as well as you would think
[1290.80-1291.36] MEE014: yeah
[1291.40-1292.92] FEE013: oh it would be flat yeah i think
[1292.64-1311.88] MEE014: you could have a flat screen inside yeah but i am just wondering whether we want an l c d screen inside it would not be like full color it would just be black and white but there would be touch touch buttons so you would not be pressing down or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r s i
[1308.02-1313.96] FEE016: yeah just a thought they would not actually need one and they could use anything they have got could not they a pencil a pen so they would not really need a
[1312.36-1320.00] FEE013: i think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see some
[1316.20-1316.78] MEE014: it is rubber
[1320.00-1327.54] FEE013: thing quite fancy looking inside now how would you distinguish if you had it there how would you distinguish where you had to press i mean
[1328.40-1331.36] MEE014: yeah i had not i had not really thought of that it would be nice
[1341.30-1350.00] MEE014: yeah you could you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost it
[1343.28-1344.62] FEE013: cause when you are pommeling
[1350.00-1350.44] MEE014: is that ok
[1350.44-1352.32] FEE013: easy to reply that well
[1353.28-1367.94] FEE016: i just raise another point well it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here cause i am not sure how it would fit in if we flip open now you know how you have got some mirrors in night gloves that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display have you seen those
[1357.40-1357.76] MEE014: yeah
[1360.14-1360.72] MEE014: yeah
[1364.52-1364.96] MEE014: yeah
[1365.92-1367.38] MEO015: ok
[1367.68-1368.56] MEE014: yeah ok
[1368.92-1379.92] FEE016: and they kind of respond to the turn of your body is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the or if they are
[1369.98-1379.96] MEO015: i wanted to share something which i did here first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the
[1374.36-1380.00] FEE013: ok we will talk about that so if you finish your i will come back to that that is you
[1377.36-1380.00] MEE014: yeah that is yeah that that is the end
[1380.00-1381.32] FEE013: ok
[1380.00-1381.02] FEE016: control display then
[1380.00-1380.72] MEE014: it is
[1380.00-1401.16] MEO015: customer needs and feasibility second is we check into competitors the picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are both of black and white so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here
[1385.08-1385.28] MEE014: yeah
[1385.32-1386.40] FEE016: they do not look at themself
[1387.72-1388.36] FEE016: just a thought
[1389.92-1390.68] MEE014: oh yeah
[1391.08-1391.56] FEE016: yeah
[1393.40-1406.08] FEE016: i do not know cause i was using the ideas for mobile phones so i was using the ideas for mobile phones we kind of got some touch on to that i think i am just trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much but we will maybe leave that one on the side
[1393.64-1410.00] MEE014: yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple i mean you d you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them cause in the in the actual flip that you would
[1402.92-1409.04] MEO015: and second thing is there is too much of confusion here no particular remote is standard
[1407.26-1407.80] FEE016: kay
[1410.00-1411.12] MEE014: have some linking
[1411.18-1412.80] MEO015: like some some people have
[1414.58-1417.40] MEO015: here you see this this is on i i
[1418.56-1427.98] MEO015: i found that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with with other models and all
[1421.16-1425.32] FEE016: that is probably forget about the mirror that was just a very question i think thought yeah
[1427.92-1428.44] FEE013: yeah
[1429.28-1440.00] MEO015: ok and second as already discussed with william we are going to have m maybe a g u g u i interface in the in the middle of the flip top and f graphic user interface
[1440.00-1444.64] MEO015: is basically which is what we do do in computer have icons or touch pad or whatever which is
[1441.56-1444.96] FEE013: we are marketing to g guys as much as we are to women
[1441.72-1442.16] MEE014: oh
[1448.64-1457.66] FEE013: well it is a remote control you are sitting watching t v are you going to want to sort of open it and say oh i do not want you to go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t v
[1448.92-1455.40] MEO015: like you have an l icons or something you you have is a good example of g u i graphic user interface
[1456.32-1459.12] MEO015: so basically a person will not point or click or s
[1459.52-1461.52] FEE013: yeah i know
[1460.12-1469.92] MEO015: press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon just simplified and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and on could be on the
[1466.12-1466.64] MEE014: yeah
[1467.50-1467.92] FEE013: ok
[1469.36-1470.00] MEE014: i mean you can
[1470.00-1482.20] MEE014: and you could do it you could have a cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l c d display it will completely blank it out but i do not know if you could get any mirror effect on that actually i am not sure
[1470.00-1477.76] MEO015: pointing device that means user button so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle
[1478.76-1487.80] MEO015: so we are having a combination of both so on the s simpler board on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
[1484.52-1485.96] FEE013: ok ok
[1497.60-1498.80] FEE016: sorry what is that for
[1500.36-1500.52] FEE016: yeah
[1510.40-1510.76] FEE013: yeah
[1515.72-1516.08] MEE014: yeah
[1516.80-1516.92] MEO015: yeah
[1523.44-1524.68] MEO015: ok
[1527.28-1527.80] FEE013: no
[1529.48-1529.96] MEO015: and the low
[1530.00-1531.64] MEO015: is it oh perfect
[1535.60-1537.74] MEO015: so the findings are too many cluttered buttons
[1538.64-1549.12] MEO015: repetition of certain bat patterns which i have already explained example the volume and channel control buttons all are confusing and in inconsistent ok we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a mail
[1548.32-1548.70] FEE013: kay
[1550.50-1560.00] MEO015: which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature we have to check into the f financial feasibility whether we can
[1555.92-1556.22] MEE014: yeah
[1558.24-1559.18] FEE013: what do you mean
[1560.00-1586.64] MEO015: and incorporate the t this at a low cost but for like we had c response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also
[1562.32-1562.72] MEE014: yeah
[1562.56-1564.92] FEE016: well you told it you know if you would flip it open and you would be
[1564.18-1569.14] MEE014: i if you yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l c d screen
[1567.04-1576.60] FEE016: would not you you would not like the idea y if s if we just use the shell as an example and you open that you have got your l c d display there and you have got the buttons there and you are holding the button
[1574.84-1575.70] MEE014: yes
[1575.50-1575.92] FEE013: ok
[1582.98-1583.28] FEE013: ok
[1590.00-1592.44] MEO015: into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
[1596.20-1611.80] MEO015: my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by marketing department they want something to do with fruit so i would not say the design should be like a fruit but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors or red chili
[1609.44-1614.28] FEE013: can we swap that round so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part
[1613.00-1620.00] MEO015: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you
[1615.64-1617.44] FEE013: cause if you are thinking about folding it
[1618.76-1620.00] FEE013: you would be using your thumb
[1620.00-1622.82] FEE013: most price just like a mobile phone
[1620.00-1622.36] MEO015: see the previous slide
[1622.50-1623.40] MEE014: yeah
[1626.08-1637.22] MEO015: i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern here so we we we would not change that particular pattern because it this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
[1630.76-1631.32] FEE013: yeah
[1635.08-1638.04] MEE014: yeah yeah but you can not do it with that one
[1635.32-1650.00] FEE013: that is what i was just saying and then have the and then have the l c d at the top and then be able to touch that for the other keypad so have the the volume and the program and things like that
[1640.16-1650.00] MEO015: this is the central one the one yeah volume and channel so keep that n that standardized because that is the most common feature across all models if you look at all
[1650.00-1652.40] FEE013: on the lower side ok
[1650.00-1651.08] MEO015: the models it is here
[1653.64-1654.16] MEO015: this
[1657.00-1657.56] MEO015: and
[1660.84-1661.56] MEO015: voice recognition
[1690.14-1690.48] MEE014: yeah
[1690.14-1690.80] MEO015: triple kinetic
[1694.76-1695.18] MEE014: yeah
[1708.38-1708.78] MEE014: yeah
[1730.76-1731.04] MEE014: yeah
[1743.52-1745.16] MEE014: well yeah we
[1749.80-1750.40] FEE016: finite
[1751.16-1751.56] MEE014: yeah
[1757.44-1760.08] FEE013: i can not see the exact play and start and things
[1757.46-1759.24] MEO015: maybe we could start with the black and white
[1760.72-1763.08] MEO015: th that would could upgrade later on up
[1761.44-1763.44] FEE013: or is that volume out channel
[1782.74-1783.24] FEE013: ok
[1787.76-1790.68] FEE013: right ok
[1792.04-1798.44] FEE013: i am not sure how long we have got left but we need to make a decision about
[1801.08-1802.02] FEE013: the things we have discussed
[1801.82-1802.08] MEO015: yeah
[1802.70-1806.28] FEE013: so we agree on
[1804.20-1804.60] FEE016: yeah
[1807.80-1809.00] FEE013: do we agree on the battery
[1811.44-1826.88] FEE013: yeah that means that there is no function for the port you know that it sits in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition through finding it it is a f it is it is like a g it is a gadget it is a
[1811.56-1812.08] MEE014: yeah
[1819.92-1820.48] MEE014: yeah
[1822.96-1824.70] MEE014: yeah i think i mean it is
[1823.70-1829.60] FEE016: no we talked about kinetic charging we seem to have decided on that did we decide on doubly or triply about it
[1827.08-1830.00] MEE014: yeah it is it is quite it is quite a cool feature to have
[1828.08-1828.92] FEE013: selling point
[1830.00-1847.92] MEE014: have and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock then it will not be cheap to remade them actually it will it will be cheap so to remade them actually so do you reckon that is a good idea that where is the remote i am here thing i think that would be quite fun
[1833.88-1840.92] FEE016: no one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double e or triple e batteries cause they have still got to be charged this way have not they oh ok
[1845.08-1846.08] FEE016: right ok got you
[1848.00-1849.20] FEE013: i think the only
[1848.40-1850.60] FEE016: got you on that ok
[1850.30-1860.00] FEE013: i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else but i think pretty much
[1851.44-1852.60] MEO015: and for the so
[1855.20-1855.56] MEE014: yeah
[1857.10-1859.98] MEO015: for the body design i think plastic
[1860.00-1866.56] FEE013: we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things the l c d is not cheap
[1860.00-1867.84] MEO015: yeah you could use the board for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design
[1863.14-1863.50] MEE014: yeah
[1865.00-1876.68] MEE014: yeah it is well it is it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full color cause if it just got a black and white one i mean they use them in calculators so
[1871.72-1872.64] MEO015: that is right
[1876.52-1877.64] FEE013: yeah ok
[1880.02-1880.42] MEE014: yeah
[1880.80-1881.96] FEE013: and you could yeah
[1884.08-1884.56] FEE013: ok
[1888.16-1888.68] MEO015: it is
[1890.54-1892.28] MEE014: what you
[1891.64-1893.12] FEE013: do you want like a backup
[1899.26-1905.02] MEE014: no the kinetic ones come come with a sort of watch a battery that goes in a watch
[1899.76-1901.68] FEE016: sorry could you repeat that last part
[1903.68-1904.64] FEE016: ok
[1906.16-1908.44] MEE014: so it is a lot smaller and so it would
[1909.82-1910.40] FEE016: ok
[1912.72-1920.00] FEE013: ok so we have got the battery the inside components is pretty standardized across the board
[1920.00-1920.60] FEE013: it is not it
[1920.84-1931.02] MEO015: and finally the body should be detachable ma maybe ch you can change the body of the case casing the case outside it should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it every time
[1921.18-1921.78] MEE014: yeah
[1921.88-1925.92] FEE013: so there is not really a decision to be made there
[1928.08-1931.10] FEE013: the buttons what did you give us as a
[1928.20-1933.78] FEE016: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell and the plastic sounds
[1934.74-1936.92] FEE013: the bare board l c d o
[1935.96-1948.32] FEE016: and it is just a oh it is rubberized and spongy apart from that we are just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors we are not going to try and make actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else on the shell because
[1936.36-1947.72] MEE014: yeah the well i think we were we are going for the l c d on that one on the buttons on the on the on the on the top one yeah
[1938.20-1939.66] MEO015: ok that will be
[1944.72-1949.36] FEE013: on the top one ok you have got the touch ok and then
[1946.56-1946.80] MEO015: yeah
[1949.26-1949.48] MEO015: yeah
[1950.04-1955.16] MEE014: on the bottom we were going to have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r s r ones
[1950.40-1950.96] FEE016: ok
[1956.54-1958.48] FEE013: ok ok
[1961.78-1970.20] MEE014: ok on the flip the flip screen the top one is going to be the l c d and the bottom one is going to be the rubberized buttons
[1970.24-1979.92] MEO015: fine we are talking of voice recognition also because that we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it is lost
[1973.36-1974.16] FEE013: no it is fine
[1976.76-1980.00] FEE016: it is not going to be the image i have got in my head
[1980.00-1996.34] FEE016: of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubberized cover that is spongy is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research
[1980.20-1981.64] MEE014: plastic ok
[1980.84-1983.06] MEO015: so are you looking at voice recognition
[1981.56-1982.56] FEE013: for the inside
[1983.36-1983.80] MEE014: yeah
[1985.78-1989.80] MEO015: or maybe like volume is a distinct last thing some devices you put on keychains
[1991.36-1998.12] MEO015: for yeah the whistle so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
[1992.28-1993.92] FEE013: oh i think so i think so
[2007.04-2009.96] FEE013: no i think i we do not want to be tacky if
[2010.00-2036.64] FEE013: if we have got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap so we could make it red we could make it psychedelic you know we could make it black and white zebra stripes but that is not really what we are focusing on what we are focusing on is the m you know yes so we could just pick anything
[2010.58-2010.74] MEO015: yeah
[2011.56-2012.64] FEE016: yeah
[2012.60-2015.40] MEO015: so you are mentioning the particularly incorporating in the design
[2018.48-2018.84] FEE016: yeah
[2020.86-2021.12] FEE016: yeah
[2022.32-2034.36] FEE016: just kinda pushing it that if he could come up with anything else but i mean i totally agree we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things this would definitely be different enough i just wanted to know if it could come up with something you do not
[2045.52-2057.88] FEE016: i think the upper mass covers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce that if in a years time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it is so easy for us to produce that that can be so up to on
[2055.20-2069.88] FEE013: that is just different it is just different from everything else and i mean i am trying to imagine clean looking houses sort of beige and black do you either want something that goes with the
[2070.00-2083.08] FEE013: with that which is what is on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting
[2081.32-2091.32] MEE014: yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized case not the actual plastic outside case just the rubber thing that goes with the things
[2085.08-2085.60] MEO015: ok
[2088.48-2088.98] MEO015: yeah
[2090.18-2090.92] MEO015: yeah
[2092.56-2093.56] MEO015: i think yeah
[2094.28-2099.98] FEE013: and you would just have a n across the b you would have so many different options that you could do
[2096.46-2099.98] FEE016: so can i just recap the
[2100.00-2106.96] FEE013: you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
[2100.00-2118.52] FEE016: the decisions that we have made kinetic charging the watch type batteries l c d display on the the top side of the flip top rubberized buttons on the bottom side we are going to use fruit and vegetable color to the rubber cover the case itself is plastic that is how far we have got what else do we have to add to our decisions here
[2111.72-2113.96] MEO015: i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
[2116.28-2129.96] FEE013: and ones that ones that have rubbery spikes you know you could just go so far with it like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that is quite a flexible
[2130.00-2131.76] FEE013: oh ok
[2130.96-2136.36] FEE016: yeah it is we are just a cost issue with that but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost of it
[2136.68-2137.20] FEE013: yes
[2141.52-2143.24] MEE014: oh yeah yeah the whistle one too
[2145.40-2145.80] FEE013: oh yeah
[2149.62-2149.88] FEE013: yeah
[2152.26-2157.10] FEE013: ok we have got five minutes or that might have been up for a while
[2157.04-2159.64] FEE016: and incorporating the company logo
[2165.72-2175.84] FEE016: yeah cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from it from your report that it is not just a case of having a little r r sitting somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
[2178.36-2181.20] FEE016: cause it is one of its kind on the market but it is good enough
[2184.28-2184.56] FEE016: yeah
[2187.84-2188.36] MEE014: yeah
[2188.52-2188.92] FEE016: ok
[2197.12-2197.56] FEE016: ok
[2200.30-2208.42] FEE016: ok did we i know at the last meeting when we spoke about a beeper i think that was you talked about a beeper for location have we just rejected that in favor of noise recognition
[2209.88-2211.64] MEE014: yeah depending on the expense of it
[2216.08-2217.80] MEE014: yeah i have got him stocks and yeah
[2221.32-2222.08] FEE013: have you
[2226.58-2227.16] FEE013: ok
[2228.72-2229.04] MEE014: yeah
[2231.52-2231.88] MEE014: ok
[2235.56-2249.98] FEE013: well they do but i think we can well it is it is i think you just address that with advertising you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work
[2239.34-2239.96] MEE014: yeah
[2246.68-2247.56] FEE016: so it is closed
[2250.00-2260.56] FEE013: for you obviously it will have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it the point is that it has got to send out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i am not worried about that
[2268.76-2276.40] FEE013: depending on how i mean we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into so
[2280.00-2293.24] FEE013: turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else then it is worth thinking about but i think we will find out more about cost afterwards right i am going to wrap it up there
[2296.32-2303.34] FEE013: we have got our end meeting now about to do a little so
[2305.20-2309.98] FEE013: so i think we have probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so
[2310.00-2312.54] FEE013: think we have probably got about that time before we come back
[2314.36-2315.24] FEE013: it is either that or
[2316.24-2321.08] FEE013: we only had fourteen minutes to discuss what we just discussed and i do not know how long that took even
[2325.88-2326.76] FEE013: is everyone happy
[2331.24-2331.80] FEE013: ok

============================================================
SESSION: ES2004d
============================================================

[   3.68-   6.86] FEE013: if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time
[  13.40-  14.12] MEO015: no
[  15.12-  16.00] FEE016: sounds awesome
[  19.96-  20.72] FEE013: is that
[  23.00-  23.44] MEO015: thank you k
[  24.12-  25.26] FEE013: to be apparently
[  26.08-  26.84] MEO015: ok
[  27.38-  28.56] FEE013: ok i will switch to them
[  27.84-  28.38] FEE016: i switched off
[  29.06-  29.64] MEO015: ok
[  32.72-  35.52] FEE013: you are good to go ok
[  36.64-  39.52] FEE013: minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger
[  40.92-  45.62] FEE013: standard chip cause it can come in various different sizes it was not a
[  47.08-  59.96] FEE013: going to be a problem factor we wanted a standby function the case materials could be soft rubbery changeable buttons with a combination of l c d and rubber according
[  60.00-  82.48] FEE013: design bright funky designs inspired by fruit keeping with the hip kind of feel and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we find out more about the cost of things like that and the rubber buttons that we will use will be anti r s i ok
[  88.56-  90.00] FEE013: prototype presentation
[  91.36-  92.62] MEE014: is that for us
[  92.60-  93.80] FEE013: i think that would be you
[  92.84-  93.32] MEO015: yeah
[  94.10-  94.48] MEE014: ok
[  94.68-  98.96] MEO015: me and william worked on a prototype and i think william is going to make a p present return
[  99.50- 109.40] MEE014: yeah shall i show i will show oh do you do you want to do you want to show hold do you want to hold it and i will i will show you the presentation can i just make it
[ 100.76- 101.10] MEO015: yeah
[ 103.24- 105.52] FEE013: make sure my hand is
[ 103.62- 104.68] MEO015: i can hold it like
[ 106.04- 107.40] MEO015: yeah
[ 109.02- 110.84] FEE013: yes yes you can frizzy i will get it out
[ 114.80- 115.32] MEE014: wow
[ 115.96- 116.56] MEO015: it looks
[ 116.56- 117.72] MEE014: yeah we are crazy over here
[ 117.88- 118.82] MEO015: very clean
[ 120.76- 121.40] MEE014: thank you
[ 125.40- 131.36] FEE013: you should have one of those things and you can just take it off
[ 129.84- 130.08] MEO015: yeah
[ 132.12- 134.52] MEO015: oh where are the hinges
[ 138.62- 150.00] MEE014: ok so this is our look and feel presentation our final our final presentation and we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there
[ 141.72- 142.16] FEE013: ok
[ 150.00- 179.98] MEE014: it is going to have a a plastic body with a sort of standard color either we are thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something this is underneath the rubberized the rubberized outer casing which there would be sort of a wide choice they would be attached but we can we can come up with it
[ 153.04- 153.88] MEO015: yeah yeah
[ 155.58- 155.92] MEO015: yeah
[ 178.12- 178.46] FEE013: ok
[ 180.00- 202.60] MEE014: the wide choice of colors and sort of patterns so you have got you have got a lot of customization with it it is obviously in a sort of clam shell design and the the top l c d screen that you can see there would would be sort of
[ 204.24- 209.88] MEE014: how do you say it is yeah yeah it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the
[ 204.80- 207.52] MEO015: yes yeah yeah it would be so
[ 209.04- 209.94] FEE013: it is
[ 210.00- 210.50] FEE013: oh
[ 210.00- 233.96] MEE014: downs at the bottom would so so it will fully close flat yeah yeah and working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually thinking about it now c you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get the
[ 214.92- 216.00] FEE013: oh right ok yeah
[ 233.24- 238.76] FEE013: so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section cause it is the top part that is ok
[ 234.76- 237.08] FEE016: or something
[ 235.48- 239.98] MEE014: yeah it is it is yeah
[ 240.00- 257.80] MEE014: we decided that the voice recognition system it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of so we presumed that they would also be quite cheap so you would have something like where you would shout out where where is the remote and
[ 259.12- 261.28] MEE014: it will shout back i am here or something
[ 264.60- 270.00] MEE014: and then yeah it w it will not shout out i am here or something it will just
[ 270.00- 299.98] MEE014: shout out on him or something to similar effects yeah if it was getting like well that that could be something for next time maybe you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is the standard there is the standard transmission with the t v using using all the standard chips that we have talked about it would it would have obviously cause it is split over two two different layers it would need two separate p c v s that would be joined
[ 271.08- 273.50] FEE013: ok yes i am under the sofa
[ 274.64- 275.92] FEE013: oh that would be too complicated
[ 291.24- 292.62] FEE013: ok it is ok
[ 300.00- 329.72] MEE014: and the hinge through some sort of cabling and because obviously all t v s use this the same infrared medium we would just be using using the same thing to transmit the data and the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer just at the front of the we have not i do not think we have to put it on
[ 302.28- 305.32] MEO015: if actually no it would be you have to be on the on the front yeah
[ 307.52- 311.96] MEO015: so when it when it is open here the thing is pointing yes yeah
[ 326.64- 327.40] MEO015: ok
[ 327.12- 328.06] FEE016: ok
[ 329.08- 329.72] FEE013: i see
[ 330.80- 332.10] MEE014: yeah yeah something like that
[ 332.10- 338.40] FEE013: ok actually no it would be it would have to be in the in the front oh right yeah ok got it
[ 332.20- 332.74] FEE016: seriously
[ 334.20- 336.52] MEE014: yeah on the front the front side of that yeah
[ 338.82- 340.88] FEE016: ok thanks
[ 338.96- 339.60] MEO015: it is s
[ 339.80- 341.52] FEE013: it is still pointing yes
[ 339.88- 358.14] MEE014: so when you have actually got it open it would be facing the t v and then finally of the interface the top screen as we have said is would be an inset black and white l c d s touch screen which yeah would
[ 340.96- 341.28] MEO015: yeah
[ 342.32- 343.36] FEE013: yeah that makes sense
[ 344.80- 345.56] MEO015: look up
[ 355.26- 356.22] MEO015: yeah
[ 359.30- 359.98] MEE014: have
[ 360.00- 389.98] MEE014: f all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons like the fo volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and things to that effect and now we have we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have some some kind of sort of
[ 364.20- 390.00] FEE016: ok sorry this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research so this is the first stage of the evaluation now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing
[ 364.26- 367.56] MEO015: should this be the one or
[ 369.04- 372.96] FEE013: but not interfering with the light side kind of look at the product measures
[ 375.44- 375.78] FEE013: ok
[ 383.44- 385.10] FEE013: thank you very much
[ 386.52- 389.96] FEE013: wrapping it all up ok i have
[ 388.34- 390.00] MEO015: i think this was a bit short
[ 390.00- 392.00] FEE013: now got evaluation criteria
[ 390.00- 396.20] FEE016: strategy of our company so it is what we have discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those trends and requirements
[ 390.00- 390.88] MEE014: bezeled
[ 390.00- 390.36] MEO015: it
[ 392.40- 397.84] MEE014: logo on it or something inset or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
[ 397.08- 402.16] FEE013: it is to be completed so
[ 398.36- 419.96] FEE016: now the findings that we came up with just a recap are here the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones are with a spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colors the design should minimize r m
[ 400.04- 417.08] MEE014: no not not actually no not interfering with the l the whole look of the product when it is out on the thing and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics as that is that is the company logo
[ 420.00- 433.18] FEE016: s i and be easy to locate and we were still a slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there but that did seem to be the favorite strategy but there was also on the sideline a thought of maybe having a beeper function
[ 422.28- 424.16] FEE013: it is quite similar to what it was before though
[ 425.36- 425.64] FEE013: alright
[ 428.80- 431.04] MEE014: ok
[ 435.04- 449.96] FEE016: ok so we can come back to that slide if you do not have a note of those i will just show you how we are going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far we are going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false we will look at each of those
[ 450.00- 460.80] FEE016: criteria that i have just mentioned i will pull that slide back up and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here does that seem clear any questions there
[ 462.40- 463.80] FEE016: so we are going to look at these
[ 465.20- 475.20] FEE016: yes we are going to come to well we will discuss each one and we will come to our consensus rating between one and seven ok one is true seven is false
[ 477.16- 479.96] FEE016: right so i will write
[ 480.00- 494.16] FEE016: all of that out again but we will just be criteria one two three four five six or a b c d e f to confuse it with the number of ratios c d e f this is where i would like to tell you my actual one
[ 488.52- 488.84] MEO015: ok
[ 490.80- 491.84] MEO015: i do not know it is go
[ 493.36- 496.20] MEO015: is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the
[ 496.30- 497.18] FEE016: criteria
[ 501.00- 502.04] FEE016: rating
[ 502.82- 503.02] MEO015: ok
[ 505.76- 509.98] FEE016: actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating we could take an average of the
[ 510.00- 514.50] FEE016: and how are our new
[ 514.56- 518.94] FEE016: so i will just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go one two three four we know who is who
[ 526.02- 539.98] FEE016: ok criteria a the fancy look and feel how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fanf is a fancy look and feel one is true seven is false my own ratings are
[ 531.86- 532.20] FEE013: ok
[ 540.00- 541.40] FEE016: that would be a two
[ 540.96- 542.12] MEO015: yeah i see
[ 542.52- 544.48] FEE016: one is two and seven is four
[ 543.80- 544.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 548.80- 549.62] FEE016: or a six ok
[ 554.40- 555.32] FEE013: just right smiling
[ 554.96- 555.48] FEE016: a three
[ 556.78- 557.44] FEE016: ok
[ 560.28- 560.70] FEE016: two
[ 564.08- 570.00] FEE016: a four ok adding those up we have got six and a five eleven divided by four
[ 570.00- 576.20] FEE016: is what johann de gorges is that not johann de gorges
[ 570.76- 572.04] FEE013: yeah i think that works
[ 579.40- 579.76] FEE016: ok
[ 581.92- 589.44] FEE016: two five seven five there we go ok criteria being criteria being technologically innovative
[ 590.80- 593.72] FEE016: i would give that a three
[ 593.16- 595.20] MEO015: one two four
[ 597.76- 600.00] FEE016: ok not that you are biased
[ 600.00- 602.92] FEE016: no not two
[ 601.00- 601.68] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 603.24- 603.76] MEO015: yeah
[ 607.04- 607.64] FEE013: i would agree
[ 607.56- 608.16] MEO015: i think yeah
[ 607.68- 607.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 609.48- 609.78] FEE013: ok
[ 615.32- 618.64] FEE016: the average of your your your rating to be a two
[ 619.52- 620.04] FEE013: i would say a two
[ 620.36- 622.04] FEE016: is that what you are saying
[ 624.96- 627.96] FEE016: so i will work out the average for that again again it is a very slight lot of
[ 629.60- 630.00] FEE016: ok
[ 630.00- 631.76] FEE016: i am just wondering if you are ready to
[ 633.04- 634.20] FEE016: to quantify the cake
[ 637.56- 640.10] FEE016: i am just going to find it so please that is ok
[ 638.70- 646.76] MEE014: yeah i would yeah i would probably put it two yeah two or three no three three
[ 638.92- 644.28] MEO015: oh sorry man i got it wrong the first one rating i am sorry can you just make it two
[ 641.04- 644.04] FEE016: so you are rating for this one or two ok
[ 645.44- 647.56] MEO015: the first yeah i just thought it the other way
[ 645.80- 649.92] FEE016: so that is a so that means it does not have to be nice and simple yeah
[ 648.98- 649.72] MEO015: and a a
[ 651.18- 652.12] MEO015: yeah i just got
[ 651.56- 654.84] FEE016: ok ease of use easy to use
[ 656.00- 659.46] FEE016: based on what you have said there i would say one true
[ 660.68- 661.32] MEO015: two
[ 662.80- 663.76] MEE014: yeah
[ 663.92- 664.52] FEE016: two
[ 666.02- 666.60] FEE013: a two
[ 668.40- 669.52] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 668.78- 670.84] MEO015: and it is a good choice so it is possible
[ 670.24- 671.12] FEE016: two
[ 672.48- 672.68] MEO015: to
[ 674.12- 674.56] FEE016: two
[ 676.40- 689.96] FEE016: i should have said a two to make the difference we will just put almost two because i am not getting too silly decimal places ok or we or if we want to really bring it down we can not do this
[ 686.40- 687.36] MEE014: i would give it a one
[ 690.00- 703.00] FEE016: and how we are looking at it incorporates current fashion trends and that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colors
[ 690.04- 691.76] MEE014: no no not at all
[ 691.16- 692.86] FEE013: it is just two point five for that one
[ 703.62- 704.08] MEO015: two
[ 704.48- 713.88] FEE016: right so i am just thinking before i give it my red time you were limited in the use of materials for your approach to type here is this actually going to be the colors that you do
[ 723.12- 723.58] MEE014: yeah
[ 728.52- 731.58] FEE013: i would say a two i would say a two
[ 728.60- 735.84] FEE016: so you could use any strong fruit and veg colors and that is what we are intending to do ok and a spongy feel is no problem for
[ 738.40- 738.68] MEE014: yeah
[ 742.08- 742.68] FEE016: ok
[ 742.44- 745.62] FEE013: one point seven five ok
[ 745.00- 746.82] FEE016: in that case it has got to be a one for me
[ 746.40- 748.64] MEO015: white with thin plastic or blue
[ 749.38- 749.98] FEE016: yeah
[ 750.00- 751.40] FEE016: no that is ok
[ 753.08- 753.40] MEE014: so
[ 754.68- 762.96] FEE016: that part was nice anyway ok moving on to does the design minimize the ability to strain injury
[ 755.52- 756.04] MEO015: basically
[ 761.44- 761.80] MEO015: yeah
[ 763.00- 763.20] MEO015: yeah
[ 765.00- 770.08] FEE016: i do not think we have really touched on that part we have discussed it we have not really come up with anything without
[ 766.00- 767.52] MEO015: no no cause it is in the
[ 770.08- 771.16] MEO015: in the rubber
[ 771.56- 779.96] FEE016: we felt confusing we reduced that we talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control if you are someone who is zapping or sitting around trying to figure out how many people did how do you minimize
[ 774.16- 774.48] MEE014: yeah
[ 779.76- 780.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 780.00- 781.78] FEE016: i found such a small gap
[ 783.28- 783.80] MEO015: but
[ 785.56- 785.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 786.04- 786.42] FEE016: and
[ 792.52- 792.88] FEE013: yeah
[ 793.56- 793.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 801.20- 802.26] MEE014: yeah that is
[ 803.08- 803.52] FEE016: yeah
[ 803.40- 810.00] MEE014: no no the the base color was white or or like or sort of a light
[ 805.20- 805.62] FEE016: yeah
[ 808.08- 808.88] FEE016: i think
[ 810.00- 812.92] FEE016: think i am going to have to be neutral on that i will give it up for you
[ 810.00- 820.44] MEE014: blue but the changeable fa facies would allow you to get any basically any one of the number of colors that that it is full sort of custom made
[ 810.48- 810.80] FEE013: one
[ 818.14- 819.58] FEE016: that is fine i think so
[ 821.52- 824.72] MEE014: yeah and
[ 821.94- 825.04] FEE016: four point four point eight
[ 825.88- 834.88] MEE014: no no cause if that is that is the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put around it that otherwise it is just sort of hard plastic
[ 827.62- 832.04] FEE016: twenty one twenty one so that is four point two five
[ 835.60- 840.00] FEE016: and finally last but not least easy to locate have you talked about
[ 838.00- 839.50] MEE014: yeah i will give it a one as well
[ 840.00- 845.60] FEE016: at voice recognition we talked about a beeper who really in the time has come to any disposal
[ 841.36- 849.56] FEE013: well the type of button that we are going to use in the bottom half the material minimizes our insides meant to
[ 845.88- 846.72] MEE014: yeah
[ 847.32- 854.32] FEE016: it was the only thing but yeah and we are happy with the costs or not as great as we thought the cost was
[ 851.92- 862.28] FEE013: maybe because it is slightly with the size that we have got it is quite small but with the amount of stuff we are putting on it is not that much so maybe because there is more space it is not kind of moving around to an
[ 853.16- 853.64] MEO015: so
[ 855.02- 855.72] MEE014: i do not think
[ 855.46- 860.28] FEE016: that sounds good then i would go for i d we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on t v
[ 856.56- 857.08] MEE014: no
[ 862.16- 865.36] FEE016: for someone who is in the other room or t v is in different rooms and
[ 863.12- 869.56] FEE013: ok accurately the buttons in between it is quite obvious just big buttons
[ 867.48- 868.04] MEE014: yeah
[ 871.68- 874.50] FEE016: ok fill in the
[ 875.92- 876.62] MEE014: yeah
[ 876.00- 877.52] MEO015: the voice speaker
[ 877.32- 877.76] FEE016: ok
[ 879.00- 881.56] FEE016: logical that is the one for me
[ 881.52- 881.88] FEE013: four
[ 882.80- 885.64] FEE016: one and one
[ 893.12- 900.00] FEE016: so how do we feel about this we have got our our we have got the highest rating of meeting specifications i think
[ 900.00- 929.54] FEE016: is definitely true for two of the six criteria there that is for incorporates current fashion trends and an easy to locate the lowest rating we have got which is really it is not terribly low it is it is close around neutral is for the minimization of repetitive strain injury do we feel on the basis of the of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it and do we have to make further modifications
[ 902.32- 902.88] MEE014: yeah
[ 905.60- 909.56] MEE014: yeah i d i f i d go for five actually
[ 928.22- 929.02] FEE013: no
[ 931.48- 932.08] FEE013: it would be
[ 932.80- 939.32] MEE014: yeah yeah it was it was a voice sh voice recognition yeah
[ 933.44- 934.40] FEE016: i would go with that
[ 933.80- 938.44] FEE013: and if you did not hear it in the room you were standing in then you realize that it was not in that room and go into that room
[ 935.62- 942.00] FEE016: i think for most of those readings it is high enough that the upper end of the scale goes to where i think it is i really do not
[ 942.76- 945.36] MEE014: yeah yeah that yeah that is feasible
[ 943.08- 949.46] FEE016: on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we could actually do much more action in that respect
[ 943.74- 943.96] FEE013: why
[ 950.36- 958.16] FEE016: i know ok well i hope that is clear to the team is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before
[ 951.24- 953.44] MEE014: i think it would
[ 956.04- 958.92] MEE014: i think it would probably be a a standard it would be a standard
[ 959.28- 959.64] FEE016: so what
[ 960.00- 964.48] MEE014: and it it would be quite loud so it would be s yeah
[ 960.90- 965.90] FEE016: good fine i will just leave it there that is ok thank you
[ 972.24- 973.08] MEE014: yeah one
[ 977.64- 982.06] MEE014: i do realize that we might be running fairly fast through it is not it
[ 982.24- 982.92] FEE016: yes
[ 991.40- 992.20] FEE013: i do not think so
[ 994.30- 996.28] FEE013: i think we yeah i take for certain
[1004.68-1005.24] MEO015: ok
[1007.84-1010.28] FEE013: too much apart from having a ju huge big
[1018.80-1020.00] MEO015: do you want me to unblip that
[1020.24-1020.80] FEE013: do not think so
[1022.88-1026.04] MEE014: i think yeah i like it yeah
[1024.70-1025.66] FEE013: ok thank you
[1034.70-1040.60] FEE013: ok i have got finance here now i am going to plug this in so you can all see it that is ok
[1036.56-1037.68] MEO015: that is all i have
[1042.24-1042.60] FEE013: oh yeah
[1050.44-1050.72] MEE014: yeah
[1068.28-1068.80] FEE013: yes
[1078.88-1079.32] FEE013: right
[1082.62-1083.72] FEE013: now i presume
[1085.56-1086.72] FEE013: that the screen will go blank
[1087.92-1089.60] FEE013: that
[1090.00-1090.80] MEO015: chip on screen
[1096.00-1104.84] FEE013: ok we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value so i was still on for kinetic
[1104.80-1107.68] FEE016: but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can fit so
[1106.16-1109.98] FEE013: ok see it would have been handy to have this at the beginning
[1109.32-1109.88] FEE016: just be a flat bottom
[1110.00-1112.16] FEE013: it might have influenced our choice
[1110.00-1112.84] FEE016: top with one curve and top with the other one curve
[1114.42-1114.72] FEE016: yeah
[1115.10-1117.88] FEE013: right what is happening with the electronics
[1120.64-1124.24] FEE016: the other curve is at the sides but it is slightly flattened at the bottom so it does not move along but yeah
[1123.42-1123.92] MEO015: ok
[1127.62-1128.14] MEO015: yeah
[1127.96-1128.88] FEE013: the
[1130.92-1132.08] MEO015: single click
[1133.70-1134.32] MEO015: two
[1135.10-1135.44] MEE014: yeah
[1139.92-1140.00] FEE013: so
[1140.00-1141.20] FEE013: oh right ok
[1142.40-1142.96] FEE013: thanks
[1143.00-1143.68] MEO015: so we have got
[1145.20-1146.28] FEE013: so would there be two
[1147.72-1148.64] MEO015: it is one
[1148.36-1151.84] MEE014: there is regular chip on print and
[1149.72-1150.28] FEE013: one chip
[1150.68-1152.48] FEE016: what does it mean if you put point five here
[1153.80-1154.36] FEE013: ok
[1158.08-1159.56] MEE014: oh no no no the
[1161.04-1164.44] MEO015: yeah plastic one and maybe about point five
[1161.32-1162.12] FEE013: one double curve
[1161.34-1166.78] MEE014: yeah it is you you have put in three for the number of kinetic cells there should just be one
[1167.28-1168.68] FEE013: so what is a single curve then
[1167.56-1170.00] MEO015: no i think rubber since it is being used just as a casing we
[1168.02-1169.98] MEE014: in the top it is the number
[1169.48-1170.00] FEE016: right
[1170.00-1170.92] FEE016: ok
[1170.00-1171.12] MEE014: oh right ok
[1170.00-1171.00] MEO015: can put point five
[1172.88-1174.30] FEE013: so just one double
[1173.48-1174.40] MEO015: yeah cause there are
[1174.66-1179.26] MEE014: yeah and yeah just no one rick so
[1175.48-1177.56] FEE013: yeah
[1175.48-1178.94] MEO015: i think it allows point five yeah you can use that
[1177.28-1186.76] FEE016: but it is going to be part of the total cost and there is nowhere else we can we can put that in is there there is nowhere else we can count for the the rubber used in the casing so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere though
[1180.64-1183.66] MEE014: yeah one of them had one sample sensor and sample screen
[1182.52-1185.36] MEO015: means we are not using a lot of rubber actually we are using this
[1186.78-1189.56] MEO015: a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic
[1186.98-1190.36] FEE013: we have got plastic and rubber have not we
[1188.18-1191.46] MEE014: no double cut no no
[1191.24-1191.46] FEE016: ok
[1192.92-1194.44] MEE014: two cause it is two easy
[1198.50-1200.00] MEE014: yeah i would say i would say it was
[1200.00-1202.52] MEE014: yeah i think i think it is
[1202.88-1203.28] FEE013: do you think
[1204.34-1209.36] FEE016: might do it i figure if some of them were exotic overhands and such like colors
[1204.64-1205.74] MEE014: one double curved
[1206.92-1211.70] MEE014: and what no cause one yeah one is double curved and then the other one is
[1209.32-1209.72] FEE013: ok
[1214.84-1216.42] FEE013: it would be like saying we are using
[1217.76-1218.46] MEE014: plastic
[1220.58-1220.80] MEE014: yeah
[1220.74-1222.62] FEE013: see it says case material
[1223.16-1224.12] MEE014: and the other one is
[1223.86-1230.00] FEE013: so we are not actually using plastic in a case are we it is including it is including
[1232.32-1233.04] MEE014: yeah
[1239.10-1239.80] MEE014: yeah
[1242.12-1242.72] MEO015: push button
[1244.98-1245.32] MEO015: ok
[1246.94-1247.44] MEO015: single
[1248.40-1251.24] FEE013: ok we will just put it in as we will put it in as half
[1249.62-1250.08] MEO015: oh
[1253.56-1256.36] FEE013: we sh we should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway
[1257.14-1259.32] MEE014: no no that is it sounds a nice style
[1259.36-1260.00] FEE013: no we do not just
[1260.00-1263.96] FEE013: ok special color do we need that
[1260.44-1266.80] MEE014: so that should not that should not be actually on there because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get
[1266.44-1284.54] FEE013: to
[1286.34-1287.64] MEE014: yeah ok
[1287.36-1290.00] FEE016: is that not be done if you click off that square now
[1290.00-1293.84] FEE016: it does not make any difference it is more the sight that makes a difference
[1296.24-1301.28] FEE016: so it is it is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is not going to make a difference
[1304.20-1308.24] MEE014: yeah the push buttons one and l c display one
[1305.62-1308.58] FEE016: well it has not made any difference has it it has gone up again
[1310.02-1310.28] FEE016: so
[1311.34-1311.96] MEE014: and buttons
[1311.92-1315.92] MEO015: i think you could change the battery also instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery
[1313.88-1315.08] FEE016: it has gone down slightly
[1326.36-1328.84] FEE016: is there anyone who may
[1331.60-1332.64] MEO015: uncode flag
[1337.46-1338.80] FEE016: if we trom
[1337.88-1339.60] MEO015: no it is just prism
[1339.88-1346.44] FEE016: if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference
[1352.36-1356.72] FEE013: is that not gone up oh no it is seven five it is changed not a lot
[1356.90-1357.60] MEO015: but really
[1359.88-1361.14] MEO015: but i think it is a new
[1360.28-1365.08] FEE016: and people are used to buying the option of going to say you are not getting this product if you are not getting it
[1368.62-1370.56] FEE013: oh it is not calculated is it
[1371.66-1373.36] FEE016: where is the
[1372.80-1373.56] FEE013: ok there we go
[1373.74-1375.12] MEO015: i am going to look it up
[1374.52-1374.70] FEE016: yeah
[1375.32-1376.40] FEE013: it is not though
[1376.82-1377.00] MEO015: yeah
[1382.04-1383.12] MEE014: well that is a practice
[1384.22-1392.08] MEO015: what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery amount it is internal nobody looks into the battery but shape and color that is something we should should know
[1386.42-1389.44] FEE013: we have not been dealing we have not been dealing with dollars though i think
[1390.02-1390.32] MEE014: yeah
[1391.12-1394.00] FEE013: ok so the highest we have got is the electronics here
[1397.52-1398.48] MEE014: no we are right
[1397.94-1399.44] FEE013: and the interface
[1398.66-1400.22] MEO015: why is that special for
[1399.36-1402.08] MEE014: i know you have got to click off to calculate it again
[1405.16-1410.00] MEE014: k in marks yeah you might you might be assuming that that is a
[1407.72-1408.00] FEE016: yeah
[1410.00-1410.28] FEE016: so
[1410.00-1420.14] MEE014: euros it could be in dollars and then we would be fine because the exchange rate we might get about three days
[1421.80-1424.60] FEE016: but we are still working to head off
[1425.66-1440.00] FEE016: in in our recommendations because if we if we are working to head off the specifications as this is what this project team is working for we can put in our recommendations for what we have we have found and what we the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings but we need to work to that specification to start with
[1432.96-1433.48] FEE013: where is the
[1434.44-1435.66] FEE013: where is the voice recognition
[1436.48-1439.98] MEE014: yeah the standard it would make one difference
[1438.64-1439.56] FEE013: right ok
[1440.00-1454.88] FEE016: and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate as a you know in a first instance as you say we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers
[1440.00-1443.20] MEE014: the biggest problem would be taking away if you took away
[1442.12-1446.40] FEE013: well the kinetic is three if we change it to the battery it is that is minus three
[1445.44-1445.80] MEE014: if you
[1448.56-1448.92] MEE014: yeah
[1450.24-1452.40] FEE013: oh right keeps things here
[1451.00-1457.20] MEE014: if if you take away the voice i i do not i do not like to say it but if you take away the voice recognition then you have got it
[1456.96-1457.52] MEO015: make it go
[1459.18-1470.00] FEE013: we can do it some other way we can do it does not have to be voice recognition we could do the voice recognition for you know business class or something you know like a upgraded version
[1463.48-1470.00] MEE014: yeah and yeah no cause it is samples sensor sample speaker took away that
[1465.04-1467.96] FEE016: because we have done all the background work to go for that if they want to
[1470.00-1472.20] FEE013: so but wait
[1470.00-1472.06] MEE014: that will make it twelve point three five
[1470.28-1470.84] FEE016: yeah
[1475.40-1477.68] FEE016: so if we take voice recognition out
[1475.40-1480.16] MEE014: but you n yeah but you minus three plus two
[1482.82-1483.20] FEE016: yeah
[1483.26-1486.60] FEE013: so should we just change the device specification then
[1487.88-1488.32] FEE013: yes
[1489.88-1492.60] FEE016: are you sure sorry not meaning to doubt your words then
[1496.28-1499.64] FEE016: right twenty five i already got a really quibble about ten p
[1496.76-1497.16] FEE013: ok
[1499.76-1500.00] MEE014: yeah
[1500.00-1511.32] MEE014: yeah but they t by me in i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product
[1500.08-1500.52] FEE013: ok
[1501.44-1505.66] FEE016: they are quite similar in one of a million which is less than ten percent
[1512.24-1513.50] MEO015: yeah way closer to the budget
[1514.92-1516.04] FEE013: ok we can
[1515.00-1515.90] MEO015: two five
[1517.48-1529.98] FEE013: make the price fit and then say if we had our budget we would have had this because it also sets it apart from the product they like their gadgets they like something that is completely different
[1522.08-1522.48] MEE014: yeah
[1524.52-1525.36] FEE016: that is today
[1526.84-1528.56] MEE014: we we could
[1528.00-1529.32] MEO015: it is really quite funny even
[1529.40-1530.00] FEE016: ok cool
[1530.00-1534.64] FEE013: it is c some completely different associated with your company right ok so
[1530.00-1530.68] FEE016: is it
[1530.04-1531.08] MEE014: yeah we can say
[1533.70-1536.20] FEE016: is it rounded or is it round
[1537.92-1538.72] FEE016: so we are ok
[1541.50-1546.36] MEO015: i do not know but it is fifty percent is the cost half of the price would be
[1545.04-1549.08] FEE013: it is two point five no it is twelve point two five
[1547.12-1547.72] MEE014: yeah i s
[1549.96-1551.72] MEE014: and then say we are recommending
[1551.90-1554.82] FEE013: yeah well two twelve point two five times two is
[1552.96-1553.88] MEO015: i think that is the first one
[1553.36-1553.60] MEE014: yeah
[1556.68-1558.16] FEE013: twenty five because it is
[1559.56-1559.80] MEE014: yeah
[1564.72-1566.10] MEO015: select the message
[1567.94-1576.88] MEE014: about twelve point three four is it twelve point fifty is it twelve point fifty
[1574.82-1578.68] FEE013: i think agenda one was where the price was is not it no
[1592.62-1593.38] FEE013: twelve point five
[1593.16-1593.76] MEO015: seems fine
[1595.80-1597.92] MEO015: excerpt was recognition evidence
[1596.44-1597.20] FEE013: well done people
[1600.88-1607.28] FEE013: so is that got us covered for the electronics thing we do not need something else to take that place ok
[1606.56-1619.96] FEE016: i think we had our second time i think there was so much interaction so much that we needed to bounce off each other and i have certainly felt heard listened to and that in relevant areas we have been able to you know give and take and i
[1609.64-1609.96] MEO015: that is it
[1615.08-1615.48] FEE013: ok
[1620.00-1622.38] FEE016: just our remit if we are necessary
[1624.24-1624.48] MEO015: yep
[1624.26-1625.12] MEE014: oh
[1627.32-1629.20] FEE013: right so i have done that
[1630.56-1632.16] MEE014: ok
[1632.04-1635.60] FEE013: ok product evaluation
[1634.52-1634.80] MEE014: yep
[1636.26-1642.24] MEE014: no cause that that was just a bolt on x or you could just take that out
[1636.92-1645.72] FEE013: we have done room for creativity have not we because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make
[1637.04-1638.20] MEO015: i would probably use this
[1643.76-1645.36] MEE014: and it would be fine
[1647.48-1649.98] FEE013: i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork
[1653.32-1665.56] MEO015: yeah i think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody it is not like people trying to cut each other it is more of a through cohesive teamwork we came to a very pretty creative design
[1655.06-1655.98] MEE014: yeah i think that is a good idea
[1655.36-1657.36] FEE013: in the sense that
[1659.16-1668.08] FEE013: did you feel like a team or did you feel like a totally
[1666.72-1667.52] MEO015: yeah and
[1668.92-1671.36] MEO015: yeah i think and sarah you coordinated the work very well
[1669.24-1669.56] MEE014: yeah
[1681.58-1681.96] FEE013: ok
[1683.68-1685.24] MEE014: yes
[1686.76-1694.20] FEE016: maybe we should think of branching it into childrens toys and fake mobile phones or something if they are seeds
[1688.40-1688.80] MEO015: yeah
[1695.04-1696.24] MEE014: yeah i would say as a team
[1698.48-1698.84] MEE014: yeah
[1700.60-1705.50] FEE016: and do we devaluate the two roles we had for communicating and sharing information and
[1701.16-1703.08] MEE014: find out from each other yeah
[1701.84-1704.46] FEE013: thank you how did you find it
[1705.98-1709.16] MEO015: that was the best part of the
[1706.90-1708.72] FEE016: could it have been better was it adequate
[1711.30-1711.60] MEE014: yeah
[1723.16-1723.40] MEO015: yeah
[1723.18-1723.64] FEE013: yeah
[1734.64-1740.00] MEE014: yeah no i thought it it went really well and i yeah i i
[1736.96-1739.98] FEE013: yeah i like the fact that
[1740.00-1758.90] FEE013: we could say an idea and it would be suggested that there was not the best idea but no one felt like shot down you know it did not matter saying what you thought because if it was not something that was that relevant then it did not matter cause it was just another idea and if you had done that
[1740.00-1768.00] MEE014: feel that everyone was listening to and all the points that were raised seemed to have been sorted out though we did not quite make the voice recognition in there but that is that is good and i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually for if if we had seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out i think maybe it would have come out a little different but yeah
[1760.08-1764.86] FEE013: teamwork well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model
[1764.16-1769.98] MEO015: yeah i did not like moving around the room but i think it is good like to
[1765.96-1769.98] FEE013: and
[1770.00-1775.96] FEE013: i am still not caught up but that is nothing to do with the teamwork at all
[1770.00-1772.64] MEO015: we spend times individually
[1778.02-1778.36] MEE014: yeah
[1780.00-1780.64] FEE013: maybe
[1780.84-1789.22] FEE016: it is not boring from other areas it is you know bringing things from other areas in it so it is i mean nothing is new but it is applying it to a d in a different area
[1784.44-1791.32] FEE013: no that was quite funny means whiteboard digital pens etcetera what does that mean anything to do with
[1786.58-1786.94] MEE014: yeah
[1795.18-1796.00] MEE014: yeah yeah
[1798.32-1799.44] FEE016: absolutely yeah
[1804.74-1807.44] MEO015: anyone thought of a remote control with a flip top
[1805.64-1806.56] FEE013: had time to kind of
[1811.52-1819.84] FEE013: yeah cause we could just sorta say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that rather than having to email it in but it was nice having it there
[1821.04-1823.48] FEE013: like the whole picture of the thing
[1821.28-1823.32] MEE014: discuss which ones
[1821.36-1822.04] MEO015: that is my answer
[1825.78-1826.10] MEE014: yeah
[1826.64-1827.08] MEO015: yes
[1829.64-1830.00] MEE014: yeah i
[1830.00-1835.04] MEE014: think i think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
[1830.04-1830.72] MEO015: that you have
[1831.76-1832.50] MEO015: it is a ghost
[1837.08-1841.84] MEE014: had had more time and if we had been separated more
[1843.24-1843.52] MEE014: yeah
[1845.84-1846.16] MEE014: yeah
[1847.40-1847.86] MEE014: yeah
[1861.08-1889.60] FEE016: i think it is really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is is obvious and visible we see it in mobile phones a lot and that that is where we have borrowed a lot of our de ideas from there are innovations in that that people do not really want i see people wanting a model of the phone they are really happy with and they can not get it anymore it is innovation for innovation sake and i think it is wonderful that our company is so r and d based
[1869.96-1872.40] FEE013: yeah i think it is the idea is in general yeah
[1876.82-1889.76] MEO015: surprising is it means like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every f month you see a new launch or something like that and new f television products coming up but nobody giving a
[1885.76-1888.88] FEE013: yeah no well they have to come from somewhere have not they
[1890.00-1892.92] MEO015: much idea to this like so much i think everything
[1890.20-1912.16] FEE013: and as sh as we sorry good as we shown by your presentation with all of the other controls remote controls no one has thought about it particularly i mean they are slightly different so someone has been shot in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else is cause it is something we should think about but obviously no one has put any great deal of thought into it
[1893.12-1898.92] FEE016: yeah but forcing it onto people cause things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really can not
[1895.72-1895.96] MEO015: yeah
[1901.84-1903.22] FEE016: for that type of phone because it
[1902.00-1902.28] MEE014: yeah
[1904.56-1906.62] FEE016: oh there is not a cover to fit it on the other end yeah
[1909.08-1909.64] FEE016: i think
[1909.28-1910.16] MEE014: vegetables
[1912.24-1912.72] MEE014: yeah
[1931.76-1949.96] FEE013: but then when everything is really smart and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it does not go meaning that if you could have something that is a proper funky thing a funky item that is individual individual to you i mean they could even go into you
[1939.60-1942.96] FEE016: i think it was just the produ just the production cost of the
[1940.22-1949.98] MEE014: yeah i do not s i do not think the the companies are really concerned they are just like we have got a d v d player does anyone remember the remote control can not you get
[1947.24-1947.72] FEE016: god
[1950.00-1965.56] FEE013: go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic you would pay you would pay a lot extra because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you but people could have have anything that they wanted
[1950.00-1962.76] MEE014: one that we used for the last one yeah just jazz it up a bit they do not really think about it because normally the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship they are trying to ship the d v d player the video player between the two
[1958.56-1972.44] FEE016: i think in the email that we were given it was very specific i think we have done what we are required to do and i think there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things i do not think that is something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for
[1964.64-1964.92] MEE014: yeah
[1967.12-1967.92] FEE013: because of the quality
[1967.12-1967.44] MEE014: yeah
[1972.80-1973.20] MEE014: yeah
[1974.00-1980.00] FEE016: i think we have done very well to get within budget and still make such an innovative item
[1980.00-1981.52] FEE016: but i think people are really going to want
[1984.68-1985.00] MEE014: yeah
[1984.76-1990.36] FEE016: i do not know maybe i can steal their ideas and sell it but i do not know either
[1985.60-1987.08] MEO015: maybe if people are nang nang
[1991.38-1991.88] MEE014: yeah
[1995.40-1995.92] MEE014: it is
[1996.92-1997.36] FEE016: yeah
[2001.16-2001.84] FEE013: yes
[2004.60-2005.08] FEE013: yeah
[2005.70-2006.06] MEE014: yeah
[2009.72-2010.00] FEE013: well
[2010.00-2016.00] FEE013: it is innovation for money sake that people have to keep buying yeah
[2016.64-2017.20] MEO015: yeah you are right
[2018.06-2026.44] FEE013: and you can get you have got your hands set that works fine but you can not get the battery anymore for that type of phone because the phones have moved on things like that yes
[2026.44-2026.76] MEO015: yeah
[2026.92-2027.76] FEE016: general
[2027.76-2029.56] FEE013: spend less
[2031.40-2032.34] MEO015: there is a fine question
[2032.24-2033.48] FEE013: in closing
[2034.60-2039.98] FEE013: yeah our costs are below budget with
[2040.00-2047.52] FEE013: recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i do not know what do you think do you think that is takes into account
[2047.52-2049.48] MEO015: celebration you did not talk about that
[2047.92-2049.58] FEE016: still not done
[2049.96-2050.70] FEE013: overheads
[2050.84-2054.92] FEE016: well i did not have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time
[2051.56-2059.82] FEE013: like us being well paid kind of a thing and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
[2060.76-2064.32] FEE016: alright but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings do we
[2063.12-2069.98] FEE013: so it looks well it looks like it is going to be fifty percent profit you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that
[2070.00-2078.48] FEE013: so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that it sold at but i think but you were saying that that is quite
[2091.28-2093.28] MEE014: i think that was just the the physical
[2096.04-2096.36] FEE013: yes
[2096.64-2096.96] MEE014: yeah
[2099.56-2100.00] FEE013: yeah
[2100.00-2100.20] MEE014: yeah
[2100.04-2100.32] MEO015: yeah
[2103.16-2109.84] FEE013: to assume it would never get made i do not know maybe i have some ideas and felt but i am
[2105.88-2110.64] MEE014: yeah i was going to yeah i am going to fill it in after this
[2112.68-2128.92] FEE013: the project has been evaluated well and truly and we have got the meeting summary in question and oh so we have got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with so i will be delegating
[2120.88-2121.24] MEE014: yeah
[2123.28-2124.40] MEE014: yeah it was
[2130.00-2134.50] FEE013: ing in my role as project supervisor so good luck
[2138.22-2143.76] MEE014: it is top secret no it is it is it is conspiracy going on
[2139.54-2142.04] FEE013: i think the celebration is at twenty five times

[ 132.88- 146.76] FIE088: we get inst each of us will get instructions and we will take it from there project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much i do not think we have any great discussion at this point
[ 149.44- 149.96] FIE088: here is
[ 150.00- 162.32] FIE088: what this thing should be this thing we are going to design is a new remote control should be original trendy and of course user friendly
[ 165.20- 166.98] FIE088: so maybe i will make some notes of that
[ 188.06- 188.34] FIO089: ok
[ 195.04- 202.40] FIE088: ok alright here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
[ 203.78- 209.96] FIE088: that is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what
[ 210.00- 218.20] FIE088: we have come up with the same goes for the conceptual design there will be individual work and then discussion afterwards

[ 220.46- 221.48] FIO089: ok so
[ 222.76- 226.44] FIO089: with different types of design that we are going to be concerned with so
[ 236.12- 238.38] FIO089: functional conception
[ 243.94- 245.44] FIE088: ok i use this thing
[ 248.32- 251.04] FIO089: maybe we should redesign it
[ 251.80- 252.72] FIE088: yes
[ 252.80- 254.68] FIO089: after we finish the remote control we will get to that
[ 255.24- 257.74] FIE088: yeah ok alright
[ 260.02- 270.00] FIE088: then tool training try out the whiteboard a person can draw their favorite animal does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works so that in case we have
[ 270.00- 272.52] FIE088: to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
[ 274.68- 275.96] FIE088: you want to go eileen and
[ 276.20- 278.88] FIO089: ok i will see what i can do see if i

[ 288.08- 291.16] FIE088: and remember you have to press so it works
[ 290.04- 297.76] FIO089: so that it will not look like a cat
[ 308.92- 310.64] FIE088: so fat cat
[ 311.20- 318.44] FIO089: i was very fast yeah and it likes to sit like that ok

[ 336.00- 336.44] FIO089: thank you
[ 337.48- 339.60] FIO087: ouchie then
[ 347.66- 348.30] FIO084: sneak
[ 347.98- 349.78] FIO087: i am going to drusley
[ 355.86- 358.94] FIO087: it is like
[ 357.32- 358.06] FIO089: ok
[ 358.60- 359.98] FIE088: ok
[ 360.00- 360.44] FIE088: ok
[ 360.00- 364.80] FIO089: hope the kitty cat is hungry cause it all likes things
[ 367.26- 375.92] FIE088: is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
[ 377.24- 386.08] FIE088: profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
[ 386.52- 387.02] FIO089: ok
[ 387.40- 390.00] FIE088: and the production cost should not exceed
[ 390.00- 393.64] FIE088: it hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
[ 395.24- 398.52] FIO089: ok that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged
[ 400.24- 400.92] FIO089: of it
[ 402.86- 406.46] FIO089: and and fifty
[ 403.80- 412.68] FIE088: so these are all things of course to remember is the budget and when you design to materials cost etcetera
[ 419.16- 420.00] FIE088: now i
[ 420.00- 427.58] FIE088: the discussion i guess is does any one of you have experience with remote control
[ 428.70- 431.54] FIO084: yeah it is it is we we use them we use them
[ 428.94- 435.00] FIE088: ex cause we we use em we use em right every day and
[ 429.72- 430.10] FIO087: yes
[ 436.56- 449.24] FIE088: now having used the remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas
[ 450.40- 460.60] FIE088: if you like it to be smaller bigger have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that
[ 451.04- 451.36] FIO084: yeah
[ 453.94- 454.36] FIO087: yeah i
[ 459.86- 461.80] FIO084: things like that yeah
[ 461.44- 479.94] FIO087: yes i i feel that all the remote should be very compact like those which we get here nowadays it is very long and and it should have multi purpose like the remote control which we use for t v it should it should be used f for some other purpose also like
[ 465.16- 466.44] FIE088: small right
[ 480.00- 486.72] FIO087: controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system
[ 481.36- 482.60] FIE088: oh it is pretty good
[ 481.70- 484.32] FIO084: oh it is good good oh
[ 486.72- 495.26] FIE088: so it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically
[ 488.52- 489.44] FIO087: yes exactly
[ 489.96- 490.40] FIO087: yes
[ 490.40- 490.44] FIO084: yeah
[ 492.56- 492.92] FIO087: yes
[ 493.28- 495.52] FIO084: yeah yeah exactly
[ 494.72- 495.68] FIO087: yeah exactly
[ 497.24- 502.28] FIO089: at twelve fifty euros per
[ 502.76- 503.44] FIE088: well
[ 503.78- 506.72] FIO089: well who knows if we get a really good site or maybe we can do that
[ 506.20- 506.78] FIO084: yeah
[ 508.16- 509.96] FIO089: we certainly can try to i agree with you
[ 510.00- 513.56] FIO089: with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
[ 513.12- 521.08] FIE088: it should be something new it should be s it should do something different than than just what we have now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
[ 517.32- 517.76] FIO089: that is it
[ 517.78- 518.76] FIO084: yeah
[ 524.24- 538.72] FIE088: like trendy you know like if earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know maybe you should different colors or materials or you know so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shaped feels better in your hand or something you know
[ 527.82- 533.08] FIO084: yeah maybe i can different colors or materials or you know
[ 528.14- 528.80] FIO087: yeah
[ 530.68- 535.76] FIO087: yeah design should be yeah it should be different all the almost all the remotes
[ 537.04- 537.48] FIO087: yes
[ 537.72- 539.84] FIO087: s
[ 538.08- 539.24] FIO084: yeah
[ 538.52- 540.00] FIO089: ok friendly shape
[ 540.00- 540.32] FIE088: yeah
[ 540.00- 551.12] FIO089: that would help i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them they can not find it
[ 544.12- 544.56] FIE088: yes
[ 552.52- 565.64] FIE088: that is true because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or we you know whatever and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t v off and say where the hell is my my remote control yeah
[ 566.04- 566.76] FIO089: so so
[ 566.14- 570.00] FIE088: well or yeah or if it is really if it is really in a dark spot
[ 570.00- 575.80] FIE088: that it gives out a a sound or a signal yeah so if lost
[ 572.00- 574.64] FIO084: yeah some people or something like that so that we can know
[ 572.64- 576.76] FIO089: that is a yeah so actually there are beep or a light should blink
[ 576.74- 581.44] FIE088: if lost signal and throw signal you know
[ 577.00- 577.80] FIO087: should have
[ 577.04- 577.36] FIO084: should have
[ 578.60- 580.16] FIO087: a floor signal yeah
[ 580.40- 580.92] FIO089: yeah
[ 581.48- 586.34] FIO084: yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can we can just recognize where it is yeah
[ 585.68- 592.52] FIE088: exactly i mean just that is why i am saying i am just saying throw signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or
[ 587.02- 587.92] FIO084: may not be
[ 590.86- 593.02] FIO084: be it is a light or it is a light
[ 592.24- 599.98] FIO089: i do think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it was
[ 600.00- 605.72] FIO089: pond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink
[ 604.32- 607.64] FIO084: yeah pretty yeah a little yeah
[ 605.68- 629.98] FIE088: ok my my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden in in other words if is like in a dark spot meaning you know like your newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or is is behind a plant at that moment is is like is like what you call the light ce sensors you know in in that moment has a sensor gets a certain darkness
[ 608.22- 609.16] FIO087: yeah and
[ 625.56- 626.08] FIO089: ok
[ 628.28- 628.68] FIO089: ok
[ 630.00- 637.20] FIE088: it g has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss that later you know
[ 633.96- 635.08] FIO084: yeah of course they did not
[ 635.40- 636.24] FIO087: we can back it
[ 636.12- 637.16] FIO084: s so we could do it
[ 639.08- 641.24] FIO089: so the light sensor would activate the signal
[ 641.30- 658.44] FIE088: that is right you know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think voice or clapping that is not specific enough i know they are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to certain degree and
[ 652.08- 653.12] FIO084: yeah that is fine
[ 658.20- 660.00] FIO089: but it could be sometimes really obvious that
[ 660.00- 661.76] FIO089: and you still would not be able to find it
[ 661.64- 662.32] FIO084: refer the
[ 664.08- 664.72] FIE088: what
[ 665.22- 667.92] FIO089: well because you are s because you are silly because people are silly
[ 667.70- 671.60] FIE088: oh yeah well but then those people we can not help everybody
[ 668.68- 680.00] FIO089: i mean it could be on like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table you know maybe we have to move along ok
[ 672.96- 673.28] FIO084: yeah
[ 674.60- 677.72] FIO084: yeah it is functional d yeah exactly yeah
[ 678.08- 683.96] FIE088: ok we have yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good good points to start with here
[ 681.72- 685.68] FIO084: working design yeah it is it is maybe technical functional design
[ 685.84- 690.00] FIE088: ok the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you all did you get
[ 687.24- 688.70] FIO084: yeah functional design yeah
[ 690.00- 703.98] FIE088: notices on your computer for this ok so we will you will get the notice the working design i guess that is the function i d who is this industrial designer that is you
[ 690.40- 690.76] FIO087: ok
[ 706.82- 711.12] FIE088: ok so we looking for working design when we come back
[ 714.20- 714.48] FIE088: and then
[ 715.72- 720.00] FIE088: and then the technical func do you have the technical function so so you are the working design
[ 720.00- 744.64] FIE088: so you have a working design and then a functional design and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general that would be your idea and of course price that it that it that the price is a good price i mean the price is given but that with
[ 745.24- 749.86] FIO089: we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
[ 746.32- 746.76] FIE088: that is right
[ 749.44- 750.00] FIE088: that is right
[ 750.00- 758.00] FIE088: and you know besp you you will get specific instructions for that i think that is the end of the show yeah
[ 752.90- 753.20] FIO087: yeah
[ 754.24- 754.46] FIO084: yeah
[ 761.24- 763.96] FIO084: yeah even hands yeah
[ 762.78- 763.12] FIO087: yes
[ 764.72- 775.94] FIE088: so we have well we have time two two two three minutes any questions at this point or suggestions
[ 766.50- 767.80] FIO084: alright well let us see
[ 771.88- 772.40] FIO087: let us see
[ 774.08- 775.72] FIO087: ok ok yes
[ 775.48- 775.68] FIO084: yeah
[ 780.00- 787.08] FIE088: structions to work with and if you have any questions i guess you can
[ 787.58- 794.64] FIO089: ok i think i have enough to think about till our next meeting how about you people yeah ok
[ 795.56- 795.88] FIE088: ok
[ 796.50- 797.60] FIO089: alright well alright
[ 797.96- 803.60] FIE088: then we see you in about thirty minutes and see what we can come up with
[ 803.80- 804.52] FIO089: ok very good
[ 804.80- 805.08] FIE088: ok

============================================================
SESSION: IS1009b
============================================================

[  37.32-  38.64] FIE088: ok is everybody ready
[  39.72-  42.78] FIO089: i do not know i could just put on my microphone here and i will pay you out with it
[  45.12-  45.36] FIO089: kay
[  47.18-  58.68] FIE088: i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and
[  55.72-  56.12] FIO087: yes
[  60.80-  67.32] FIE088: i think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires
[  75.88-  77.02] FIO089: ok you want me to start right now
[  78.44-  79.04] FIE088: yeah
[  79.32-  86.44] FIO089: ok well could you put my slides up cause i think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time
[  86.28-  86.64] FIE088: ok
[  95.60-  97.04] FIE088: you are participant four
[  96.82-  98.86] FIO089: for the purpose of four i believe yes i think
[ 100.68- 101.12] FIO089: kay
[ 100.96- 103.76] FIE088: ok ok first screen
[ 104.20- 104.60] FIO084: open
[ 106.28- 107.52] FIE088: oh ok
[ 108.46- 119.58] FIO089: ok ok well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is w is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide
[ 110.40- 111.16] FIO084: ok
[ 120.68- 149.98] FIO089: this is that is where my discussion starts alright well since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody and the reason i just put that there like that is that in the initial in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions you know you could say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run
[ 150.00- 165.32] FIO089: in your car it should heat up your motor it should turn on your c d or whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility
[ 155.16- 155.40] FIO084: kay
[ 165.60- 179.96] FIO089: so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is going to be to add a feature or how expensive it is going to be or if your time it takes five years to develop this it is just something we can not do
[ 171.68- 172.04] FIO084: b
[ 173.84- 174.00] FIO084: b
[ 174.56- 175.04] FIO084: b
[ 177.48- 178.40] FIO084: yeah
[ 179.12- 179.32] FIO084: yeah
[ 180.00- 209.98] FIO089: so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can f throw anything in and then just weed things out that can not be done for one reason or another and then the things that seem the most attractive that to to a customer will try to then prioritize those so that was what i meant there and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money because if we are going to sell
[ 210.00- 213.24] FIO089: this thing i think the best time to sell this is a christmas present
[ 213.60- 239.96] FIO089: twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase we want somebody to see it and think it is j i have just got to have that and take out their wallet and buy it so it is going to be really attractive and it but it is got to go to market by september cause anything that you do not have already out there in september showing it around is not going to sell for christmas and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell
[ 215.72- 217.40] FIO087: it is a little bit too close
[ 240.00- 261.00] FIO089: me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prio help me with that prioritizing of of the features and of the the look and the color and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view
[ 252.00- 269.98] FIE088: ok can can i at this point interject something we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext because that is
[ 261.32- 269.98] FIO089: i will be coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you and i will be coming to you to tell me what is going to make somebody take
[ 261.84- 262.38] FIO087: ok
[ 270.00- 291.08] FIE088: of outdated the internet and according to to higher management the it should only control the t v mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to to to include other things and they are concerned with the time to market
[ 270.00- 292.06] FIO089: out their wallet you know what what is what is going to really be what they call the sizzle cause we got to sell the sizzle a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is in the thing that somebody is really just going to take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever ok can we go to the next slide please
[ 277.00- 277.56] FIO087: ok
[ 284.40- 285.82] FIO084: it is
[ 291.96- 299.96] FIE088: ok and the and the third thing that they want to make sure that they are that the corporate image is
[ 294.86- 299.12] FIO089: alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas
[ 300.00- 329.64] FIE088: being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product so that it is easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out so i just wanted to interject this here so we are not getting too much off track here with the with the things we want to look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things so it is only going to be t v
[ 300.00- 329.96] FIO089: looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the the whole house idea really is not going to be possible so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything i would like the suggestions to be really specific so that we will have a list of things we can cross off not something like you know whole house control like we and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget
[ 330.00- 335.08] FIE088: but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea
[ 330.00- 344.60] FIO089: that we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at we should be able to make it work the t v the v c r the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp have to wind up
[ 336.40- 337.28] FIE088: intact
[ 345.68- 346.36] FIO089: yeah sure
[ 353.20- 353.60] FIO089: ok
[ 361.12- 361.44] FIO089: ok
[ 381.32- 382.12] FIO089: of course yeah
[ 383.08- 384.36] FIO089: ok so it is something
[ 395.40- 395.74] FIO089: ok
[ 397.00- 420.00] FIO089: alright thanks for that alright now o other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now is a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use and that was thirty four percent of even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room so
[ 420.00- 448.72] FIO089: those are two things that we definitely do want to address we want to s make it as simple as possible we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate ok can we go to the next slide please
[ 449.64- 450.00] FIO089: ok
[ 450.00- 479.84] FIO089: so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle that is the selling point the thing that is going to make it an impulse purchase because once there is no be back well in sales they always say you know be backs do not come back if somebody says oh i will come back and get it next week you are dead they are never going to come back and buy it you have got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing
[ 451.18- 451.88] FIO084: yeah
[ 453.34- 454.98] FIO084: yeah yeah sure thank you
[ 462.48- 463.80] FIO084: number two
[ 469.68- 470.08] FIE088: ok
[ 470.94- 471.58] FIO084: yes
[ 473.04- 474.60] FIE088: and
[ 473.76- 475.92] FIO084: can you make it a full screen please
[ 475.96- 480.00] FIE088: who would be next i guess that would be
[ 478.40- 480.00] FIO084: no that is like a part way
[ 480.00- 481.82] FIE088: you
[ 480.00- 481.24] FIO084: have to press here
[ 480.54- 509.90] FIO089: and in order to make it really saleable we have got to shorten the learning curve make sure it is really intuitive and easy to use we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that is why i am saying simplicity is good finding it is important obviously you can not use it if you can not find it so we have got to concentrate on the features that help you find it and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros so it has to have an
[ 481.88- 484.80] FIE088: you want me to get yours right show up
[ 482.44- 485.92] FIO084: a cup cup shape the third third
[ 487.72- 496.44] FIO084: yeah exactly so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller can we go to the next slide please
[ 490.84- 493.66] FIE088: and you are number three number two
[ 498.32- 509.96] FIO084: the method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can not be a
[ 504.24- 504.66] FIE088: ok
[ 505.80- 506.14] FIE088: ok
[ 508.28- 508.62] FIE088: but
[ 510.00- 539.96] FIO084: ele an electric supply like you have to like switch connect connect connect your remote controller to power supply from the you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery because remote controller should be like you you you should take it to to wherever you want and then this integrated circuit it take takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a in
[ 510.00- 528.96] FIO089: value that when somebody looks at it they say twenty five euros i am not going to take that has to be so great that they are going to say oh twenty five euros is not much and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign ok that is a a value for me right now
[ 514.56- 515.24] FIE088: yeah yeah
[ 517.98- 518.72] FIE088: right
[ 523.62- 524.20] FIO087: it is a
[ 535.86- 536.42] FIO087: it is a
[ 540.00- 546.00] FIO084: fro infrared bits and it sends it it to the device like a t v or a air conditioner something like that so
[ 546.40- 570.00] FIO084: a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the the remote controller it sends some bits some f waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is it should re recognize the waves which
[ 570.00- 596.00] FIO084: are coming from the remote control and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote remote control will send a send a send a signal and the t v it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that change the volume control and so i think it is hard to design a remote control for multiple devices
[ 583.28- 583.64] FIO089: ok
[ 596.92- 599.98] FIE088: yeah but it is by itself
[ 598.52- 599.04] FIO084: ok yeah
[ 600.00- 602.52] FIE088: yeah
[ 603.52- 604.02] FIO084: yeah
[ 603.56- 603.92] FIE088: yeah
[ 606.28- 629.98] FIO084: so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there so you can control whatever you want you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to mute mute the t v or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there is a sh there should be some device to tell
[ 630.00- 640.40] FIO084: what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t v can perform the actions
[ 640.20- 640.60] FIO089: signal
[ 641.12- 643.16] FIO084: so can you go to the next please
[ 643.80- 659.98] FIO084: i i just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller i think these are the very simple features and they do not take much much of the investment also it is like the text or buttons which
[ 647.28- 660.00] FIO087: i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just i just just yeah just just just just just just just just
[ 656.48- 659.96] FIO089: yeah well that is already been eliminated by management so we are off the hook
[ 660.00- 674.12] FIO084: which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark
[ 660.00- 662.92] FIO089: yeah
[ 674.64- 675.04] FIO087: yes
[ 675.06- 689.96] FIO084: and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is th this is not a
[ 688.12- 689.60] FIO087: oh yeah that is good
[ 690.00- 719.92] FIO084: you know action there there can be no action taken to that so and there should be a child lock like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can not be like you if you if you have k kits and all then they will be playing with remote controller so you can lock the remote controller if make it usable for more than one device it is it is hard but i think it is possible yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so
[ 694.00- 694.60] FIO089: ok
[ 702.34- 702.96] FIO089: ok
[ 707.00- 707.60] FIO087: s
[ 715.84- 719.96] FIE088: i think it is possible for already yeah already yeah
[ 720.00- 722.36] FIE088: it is a it is a p yeah p yeah
[ 720.00- 733.50] FIO084: it is it is ok yeah and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know a all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and so that
[ 726.24- 726.84] FIO087: channels
[ 732.08- 732.40] FIO087: yes
[ 734.88- 737.88] FIO084: yeah yeah yeah and colors also different colors and
[ 737.00- 737.40] FIE088: yeah
[ 737.38- 737.76] FIO087: yes
[ 740.08- 745.68] FIO084: no no i d i do not think it will be like you can have you know f if you want that that would be me
[ 744.36- 747.48] FIE088: it just build a mold basically and you know
[ 746.28- 749.26] FIO084: yeah yeah it is it is just a shape so it does not matter
[ 749.30- 750.00] FIE088: is the button really
[ 750.00- 754.64] FIE088: ing at if you have built one more that i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is going to be square or
[ 751.80- 752.32] FIO084: yeah
[ 763.00- 765.72] FIO084: yeah that is also possible i yeah i yeah yeah
[ 763.00- 771.68] FIO089: yeah that is good from a marketing point of view would be fun the fun shape but that you you say that will not add too much to the budget to the shape is
[ 763.56- 764.08] FIE088: oh yes
[ 765.32- 780.00] FIE088: yeah
[ 767.12- 767.76] FIO084: yeah that would be
[ 771.20- 772.04] FIO084: yeah
[ 776.36- 779.98] FIO084: yeah which like an animal yeah
[ 780.00- 809.98] FIO084: yeah yeah and and the button buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated if you have less features then your remote controller will not be attractive so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in in did it for two or three operations like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press
[ 785.56- 792.66] FIO089: do you think there is any chance of having so in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
[ 786.72- 798.74] FIE088: a little elderly a little athritic hand you know and and it is a small button and and they do not press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they are very frustrated you know
[ 794.16- 796.82] FIO089: is that going to be possible cause that might help with the marketing
[ 799.88- 800.28] FIO087: ok
[ 801.44- 809.98] FIO089: because we had something sort of sexy for adults so we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape for an or
[ 810.00- 819.00] FIO084: the other button in another than mode it will change the color so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
[ 810.68- 812.46] FIO087: to give the remote yes
[ 814.12- 816.48] FIO087: a case holder a holder remote holder
[ 818.60- 839.98] FIO089: well i think i think that that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person because i think there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature cause i think one of the things people were complaining about in my when i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one the changing modes was something i mean
[ 821.00- 821.92] FIE088: get to that with you
[ 821.96- 823.10] FIO084: yeah
[ 838.80- 839.98] FIO084: yeah no it is like you
[ 840.00- 840.44] FIO084: yeah
[ 840.00- 846.68] FIO089: you and i all for all four of us who work with computers all the time changing modes is nothing for us but people who
[ 841.80- 843.36] FIO084: yeah
[ 842.84- 845.28] FIE088: yeah that is a good clock yes
[ 846.92- 870.00] FIE088: yes yeah and you have seen a lot of computer
[ 848.96- 849.60] FIO084: yeah
[ 851.72- 852.24] FIO084: yeah
[ 856.48- 857.80] FIO084: yeah yeah
[ 857.56- 870.00] FIO089: it is and it is the kind of thing people learn by feel and you do not feel the mode change so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help
[ 861.76- 865.24] FIO084: yeah you do not you should yeah
[ 870.00- 872.56] FIO084: yeah shapes also different shapes yeah that
[ 870.00- 882.52] FIO089: you know like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it but we will get to that with you
[ 873.72- 874.04] FIO084: ok
[ 876.40- 876.76] FIO084: yeah
[ 878.44- 878.72] FIO084: yeah
[ 880.80- 887.88] FIO084: yeah yeah and also text should be very clear so that there there will not be any ambiguities whether
[ 885.88- 887.88] FIO089: that is right yeah no that is a good point yeah
[ 888.92- 900.00] FIO084: and display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock it i d i do not think it will take any money extra money because i mean if we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely
[ 899.04- 899.72] FIO087: spend
[ 900.00- 901.80] FIO084: fit that feature into the circuit switch
[ 901.08- 902.72] FIO087: yes no no i am three
[ 901.44- 908.90] FIO089: yeah that is that is a good that is a good one because the clock could be really friendly and when when is your favorite show coming on and and
[ 903.12- 904.40] FIO084: yeah that is really cool
[ 905.56- 906.32] FIE088: yeah
[ 905.64- 905.92] FIO084: yeah
[ 907.56- 910.92] FIO084: yeah and then you can see or and you can yeah yeah yeah yeah so
[ 910.36- 929.98] FIO087: ok i am full yes yes yes ok as a user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote yeah can you please go on to the next slide so i found out that the
[ 910.84- 918.12] FIO089: yeah and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute yeah that is that is good the clock is good ok
[ 913.16- 913.40] FIO084: yeah
[ 917.12- 930.00] FIO084: yeah can you go to the next slide please components the main components we need for it are like buttons and underneath that there should be switch and bulbs
[ 919.20- 919.44] FIE088: yeah
[ 930.00- 942.64] FIO084: like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t v is on suppose then the remote controller should automatically have a s light
[ 930.00- 938.24] FIO087: the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance
[ 936.12- 937.38] FIE088: hold of the antenna
[ 939.86- 959.98] FIO087: now for that a a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t v and it can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t v there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infra red light or a led which can
[ 943.84- 958.80] FIO084: then it will be like if you switch on your t v through another another source not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light maybe we can have that whenever the t v is on remote controller will have a light
[ 960.00- 967.92] FIO087: be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it
[ 960.20- 980.76] FIO084: and then infra red bulbs this is like a when it is dark and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip chip which is like a brain together little controller which does all the operations and voice connecting all chips switches lights everything so there should be wires
[ 961.76- 962.16] FIE088: ok
[ 969.76- 979.64] FIO087: now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particu a particular program or switching on and off a c a particular program according to the user choice
[ 971.64- 972.74] FIE088: oh we do not have to
[ 980.74- 981.96] FIO087: yes yes
[ 981.64- 989.98] FIO084: and of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put
[ 983.88- 989.92] FIO087: so if if you want to view a particular program at say nine o clock he can set the time and the
[ 990.00- 992.02] FIO084: to give a shape yeah
[ 990.00-1020.00] FIO087: will automatically it will switch on at that particular time so he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel and the the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compact
[ 993.08- 993.52] FIO089: case
[ 995.10- 995.80] FIO084: yeah hold it
[ 999.44- 999.78] FIE088: this one
[1000.16-1001.92] FIO084: yeah i do not even need to give an explanation
[1002.86-1004.64] FIO084: next slide please
[1006.10-1018.50] FIO084: i have referred the site the home page of the our website from where i have i got s few points
[1017.42-1019.16] FIE088: and twenty
[1020.00-1021.56] FIO087: ness of the c remote
[1020.20-1021.48] FIO084: that that is it from me now
[1020.40-1021.60] FIE088: you are number two
[1023.06-1023.40] FIE088: ok
[1023.84-1042.08] FIO087: the remote should be compact and it should n it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t v television and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t an alphabet for more compactability
[1027.16-1031.24] FIO089: so we should visit this site and have a look at what is up there
[1030.36-1031.40] FIO084: ok
[1030.68-1033.56] FIE088: what do you want the two full screen yeah ok
[1032.76-1041.72] FIO084: it is not like that i have referred the page to get new ideas of like what can be the working design to how it works and all that sort of
[1037.46-1037.88] FIO089: ok
[1041.28-1043.76] FIO089: ok so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
[1043.54-1049.98] FIO087: and and and there is one more point which i noted it down like the material which
[1044.52-1045.12] FIO084: if you want
[1045.40-1046.36] FIO089: ok thank you
[1045.68-1046.48] FIO084: yeah
[1050.00-1075.24] FIO087: which which is used for remote should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some ed allergy to either children or to an adult person and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a a person if so if somebody wants to get a put around eight eight p m and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote
[1052.84-1056.08] FIO089: did you go back to that slide where she had that s side up that is a
[1056.36-1059.26] FIO084: it is actually there in there on the screen
[1060.10-1061.12] FIO089: yeah ok thank you
[1078.32-1079.98] FIO087: yes and as done
[1080.00-1097.72] FIO087: we said the buttons can be can we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
[1099.00-1101.68] FIE088: on on on the remote yeah
[1099.14-1110.00] FIO087: and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote he he should not
[1109.44-1109.64] FIE088: right
[1110.00-1111.42] FIO087: not be harmed in any way
[1115.28-1134.38] FIO087: and findings i found out in different sites that there are different remotes which can be used there are remotes which use the infra red for controlling the different functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
[1122.84-1123.24] FIE088: yes
[1124.84-1125.96] FIE088: yeah
[1136.08-1140.00] FIO087: so there you have different types of remotes with different lights so
[1140.00-1145.12] FIO087: shows which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television
[1153.24-1154.08] FIO087: next
[1156.32-1169.92] FIO087: and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multi purpose use not no like it can it can be used as a t v control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have
[1170.00-1192.28] FIO087: child lock and then to save electricity there should not be much s more m lots of circuits and all that and if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o clock automatically so that nobody else comes later and use it
[1194.32-1197.70] FIO087: timer yeah and then you can use a timer as well
[1199.36-1199.76] FIO087: yes
[1201.48-1201.96] FIO087: yeah that is it
[1216.96-1217.24] FIO084: yeah
[1224.90-1228.88] FIO084: yeah sure if there is a crop then there can be a crop
[1276.56-1277.92] FIO087: dnv television movies
[1313.76-1315.14] FIE088: dimer yeah
[1322.88-1325.80] FIE088: ok now we have
[1341.24-1346.78] FIO084: it is like ok it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television
[1353.84-1379.98] FIE088: on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically there would be lunch break and all that however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group and what function working design how how does it work so these are the two things we should come up with with
[1362.92-1363.72] FIO087: yeah
[1366.46-1366.90] FIO087: yes
[1380.00-1386.54] FIE088: so the first thing is maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
[1390.92-1392.64] FIE088: i guess in many ways everybody
[1394.48-1396.22] FIE088: everybody who has a t v
[1397.96-1404.96] FIE088: yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who do not have a t v they are a few but in general not
[1405.88-1410.00] FIO087: ok no generally we can we can design a remote
[1407.10-1409.98] FIE088: now talking about the target group which is
[1410.00-1439.80] FIE088: in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have subgroups we have we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers in hands so i think that is a one group that is certainly important then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear and
[1410.00-1427.76] FIO087: which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with we who have nervous problems yes
[1424.82-1426.84] FIO084: yeah t v
[1431.70-1433.48] FIO084: yeah yeah
[1433.00-1439.98] FIO087: but in a family in a family there will be a aged person children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes
[1440.00-1452.24] FIE088: i do not know how much we want to cater to children use i mean that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not
[1440.00-1446.22] FIO087: they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three
[1452.76-1469.96] FIO089: well you know there is the old motto children under six never shop alone so if you design something that is very attractive to children the mommy please mommy please you know we want it now we want to go to the store and see it that has a lot of
[1454.48-1469.98] FIE088: so this these are just some thoughts i have on it and i do not know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are going to design this one thing or whether we are looking
[1462.20-1463.24] FIO087: cost effective
[1470.00-1482.24] FIE088: at what we like we we are talking about different shapes whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups
[1470.00-1470.94] FIO089: of
[1482.72-1483.16] FIO089: yeah
[1484.24-1484.54] FIO087: yes
[1487.62-1489.80] FIO089: i could make a banana shaped one
[1499.64-1499.96] FIE088: that has
[1500.00-1524.68] FIE088: a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think i am i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana color or whatever you know yeah for example you know but the question is really who is our target group
[1512.92-1513.24] FIO084: yeah
[1515.20-1515.68] FIO087: yeah
[1519.04-1519.28] FIO087: yeah
[1519.08-1519.42] FIO084: yeah
[1521.20-1521.60] FIO084: yeah
[1523.48-1524.96] FIO089: respect
[1526.48-1528.68] FIE088: do we look at one target group
[1530.56-1540.92] FIE088: and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at
[1537.74-1555.36] FIO087: but yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cause twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people
[1542.96-1549.64] FIE088: sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
[1550.08-1553.24] FIO089: what about the electronics that is not really going to change much is it
[1550.72-1554.90] FIE088: out of the cost we are supposed to respect
[1554.04-1556.92] FIO089: that that w that will not change much will it
[1558.08-1559.10] FIO089: i i would agree with you
[1559.70-1560.00] FIO087: ok
[1560.00-1560.08] FIO087: yeah
[1565.76-1566.58] FIO087: ok
[1567.16-1567.52] FIE088: right
[1569.48-1569.96] FIO087: ok
[1569.48-1569.80] FIO089: yeah
[1575.38-1576.16] FIE088: with with
[1577.64-1584.44] FIO084: we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know that is that is yeah
[1581.76-1582.12] FIO089: yeah
[1582.96-1583.72] FIE088: well that is that is
[1586.64-1588.08] FIO084: children and middle aged yeah
[1594.46-1594.80] FIO089: yeah
[1595.78-1611.24] FIO084: yeah of course that we can do but specifically if if like elderly people want big buttons then you can not really make a bit big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big com remote control for elderly and for children like in the definition
[1603.62-1619.88] FIO089: that is right and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes the same electronics and basically all that is going to be different is the plastic
[1609.40-1610.80] FIO087: yeah
[1612.94-1614.46] FIO084: no it it does not cost anything
[1616.44-1618.72] FIO084: yeah does not does not does not
[1618.04-1619.96] FIE088: the question to be addressed
[1620.00-1649.98] FIE088: here is only who is the target group and how will it function and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know or within the target group or sub groups the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense i mean the basic design i understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back if let us say forty percent
[1620.00-1627.56] FIO089: case and in that case we could probably molded plastic is not all that expensive is it you are as an industrial person
[1620.48-1620.92] FIO087: yes
[1623.00-1623.30] FIO084: yeah
[1630.18-1630.44] FIO087: yeah
[1637.88-1638.20] FIO089: yeah
[1647.24-1648.80] FIO089: i do not know there is a real idea yeah
[1649.48-1649.92] FIO084: yeah
[1650.00-1654.28] FIE088: percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
[1650.00-1650.84] FIO084: yeah
[1655.32-1663.52] FIE088: so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t v
[1656.12-1660.16] FIO084: i do not think no
[1660.44-1660.68] FIO089: yeah
[1664.40-1664.70] FIO089: right
[1670.56-1671.12] FIO089: yeah
[1675.52-1677.48] FIE088: yeah well that is that is the question
[1682.28-1683.22] FIO089: an alternate package
[1686.34-1687.24] FIO089: yeah ok
[1688.48-1709.98] FIE088: well maybe there is there is an idea you know the new for example new portable phones they have like removable plastic cases so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that that in each package you know you have you you have you have
[1694.60-1701.32] FIO084: yeah like for mobile phones we have different you know covers like designs and all so that you can have
[1706.16-1708.40] FIO089: well i think we have got only a four step difference
[1709.20-1709.42] FIO084: yeah
[1710.00-1723.72] FIE088: example you you have let us say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another color or a stripe or whatever that already comes in the package and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately
[1714.04-1714.74] FIO089: thumbtch
[1725.06-1726.50] FIE088: you know yes
[1729.28-1739.96] FIE088: that is right and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe or whatever they have as another one in the package then they can go to the store and for a few francs or
[1735.88-1736.48] FIO084: yeah
[1737.56-1739.04] FIO089: where do you finish reading that
[1740.00-1746.96] FIE088: euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example you know
[1740.04-1740.46] FIO084: yeah
[1745.04-1748.96] FIO089: well we may have to come back to you or to be supported at our next meeting but
[1761.16-1762.00] FIO089: ok but
[1765.48-1769.98] FIE088: well i think i think the idea here is to to to design one remote
[1770.00-1770.28] FIE088: mean
[1770.28-1790.58] FIE088: and what the only change is going to be the func t yeah the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
[1770.28-1771.60] FIO089: ok fair enough
[1776.68-1781.44] FIO084: yeah maybe yeah but if we do some more research maybe
[1779.22-1779.68] FIO089: ok
[1790.30-1797.52] FIO084: yeah i think the b seventy percent is a unique more preferent twenty percent yeah
[1792.86-1795.56] FIE088: five minutes that was i guess that that is the old message
[1798.24-1799.92] FIO084: yeah yeah that is true
[1798.28-1799.98] FIE088: finish meeting now
[1800.00-1802.40] FIE088: yeah
[1808.92-1820.24] FIE088: but i think we i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
[1812.80-1813.26] FIO084: much
[1821.44-1822.48] FIE088: do we agree do we
[1824.72-1830.00] FIE088: do we agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
[1830.00-1830.28] FIE088: on
[1831.40-1834.46] FIE088: ok so now i understand it is lunch break
[1835.48-1836.32] FIE088: and
[1837.76-1839.22] FIE088: so that is what we will do
[1842.20-1843.24] FIE088: so thank you very much
[1844.40-1846.90] FIE088: and we will see you after lunch

============================================================
SESSION: IS1009c
============================================================

[  40.24-  40.68] FIE088: ok
[  42.16-  43.00] FIE088: hello everyone
[  43.24-  43.44] FIO084: hi
[  43.38-  43.80] FIO089: hi
[  44.78-  47.18] FIE088: how how are we doing
[  48.28-  48.76] FIO084: are they good
[  49.28-  59.98] FIE088: first we going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less in the last meeting the marketing
[  60.00-  68.70] FIE088: the manager had presented her method of working meaning gathering suggestions
[  69.96-  79.04] FIE088: from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at the within the budget that was given
[  81.40-  88.20] FIE088: in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
[  90.00- 100.96] FIE088: it is also an item that people lose a lot so we should address that and of course it should be something
[ 101.96- 104.16] FIE088: that is very simple to use
[ 105.56- 116.76] FIE088: in addition to that to make it sell of course the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
[ 117.78- 120.00] FIE088: so that the people are buying it now
[ 120.00- 130.04] FIE088: no because in particularly smaller items that is a very important fact cause if they say well i go home and think about it that will not work
[ 130.80- 137.48] FIE088: also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve
[ 138.68- 143.16] FIE088: and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
[ 145.44- 150.00] FIE088: our technical manager has then said that
[ 150.00- 151.56] FIE088: he feels it should have a chip
[ 153.04- 160.40] FIE088: that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip
[ 161.44- 172.64] FIE088: therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep if too many buttons are pressed
[ 173.84- 179.96] FIE088: a child lock and
[ 180.00- 183.72] FIE088: maybe a display clock so that people could
[ 184.92- 191.44] FIE088: you could see the time you know what show they want to watch also mentioned was maybe different shapes
[ 193.36- 203.56] FIE088: so the components of the thing should be button bulbs infra the infrared bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder
[ 204.68- 208.52] FIE088: for the for the item
[ 210.24- 228.56] FIE088: franchina who is our interface designer has mentioned that the there of course should have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock
[ 213.72- 214.88] FIO087: interface design
[ 230.10- 240.00] FIE088: particularly this maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable it should be compact her personal favorite was it should be t shaped
[ 240.00- 247.92] FIE088: and maybe have an an alarm clock and material should possibly be no of non allergic nature
[ 250.22- 256.98] FIE088: the different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves
[ 258.04- 264.80] FIE088: maybe it should have a electro electricity electricity saving feature
[ 270.00- 277.24] FIE088: can program their favorite program on right from the remote
[ 277.32- 277.84] FIO087: yes
[ 279.08- 285.08] FIE088: are we all in agreement that that is abou what we discussed last time ok
[ 284.08- 284.28] FIO084: yeah
[ 284.28- 284.56] FIO087: yes
[ 284.68- 286.62] FIO089: ok i got pretty much as i yell now
[ 286.88- 299.76] FIE088: ok then we i am looking for three presentations and i do not know whether the order matters much i do not i do not think so so whoever wants yeah ok
[ 297.36- 299.28] FIO087: ok i can start first
[ 300.00- 300.44] FIO087: ok
[ 305.44- 306.72] FIO087: my slide please
[ 306.10- 309.22] FIE088: ok that is ok
[ 314.20- 315.52] FIE088: ok sorry
[ 321.44- 323.60] FIE088: and that is number two right
[ 323.84- 324.10] FIO087: three
[ 324.58- 324.84] FIE088: three
[ 325.80- 326.68] FIO087: participant three
[ 328.04- 328.40] FIO087: yes
[ 335.72- 336.00] FIO087: ok
[ 337.52- 337.76] FIE088: yeah
[ 337.56- 347.10] FIO087: now as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
[ 349.04- 350.04] FIO087: next please
[ 351.32- 359.98] FIO087: ok now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television this messages could be switched on off
[ 360.00- 371.24] FIO087: message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching on to a particular channel like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
[ 373.40- 376.32] FIE088: nine what nine channel switches
[ 377.34- 377.68] FIO087: pardon me
[ 377.96- 381.28] FIE088: nine channel switches yeah
[ 379.14- 380.92] FIO087: yes nine numbers
[ 382.96- 390.00] FIO087: and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third channel
[ 390.00- 393.12] FIO087: channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
[ 395.80- 407.92] FIO087: then you should have a next button a next button channel by which you can keep on scro scrolling the channels one by one next slide please
[ 402.88- 404.08] FIO084: yeah
[ 410.40- 415.92] FIO087: then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
[ 420.00- 439.68] FIO087: can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen
[ 441.92- 449.76] FIO087: then there should th there should be some buttons which can control features like the color color of the picture the contrast
[ 450.00- 453.02] FIO087: sharpness brightness of the picture
[ 456.76- 458.72] FIO087: now there should be a memory switch
[ 462.72- 480.00] FIO087: there should be a mute button suddenly if if if viewer he gets a telephone call and if you want he does not want to switch off the t v but he he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can by
[ 480.00- 488.84] FIO087: while talking you can watch the t v now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
[ 490.46- 495.72] FIO087: it is an integrated prog programable sample sensor speaker unit
[ 498.52- 507.08] FIO087: so a remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizers you can record your own voice
[ 510.40- 539.30] FIO087: which can be recognized by a voice recogniser in the television for example if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel the t the the yeah the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel so the t v will have some recogniser which will recognize the user s voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
[ 541.16- 545.28] FIO087: so this is one one of the interface which can be created
[ 547.20- 552.32] FIO087: a very simple interface which has all the important features
[ 553.36- 554.44] FIO087: let me please next slide
[ 555.72- 570.00] FIO087: then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design
[ 570.00- 578.08] FIO087: an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly even a kid can use that so can you go on to the next slide
[ 575.76- 576.12] FIE088: ok
[ 579.00- 592.84] FIO087: yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this v voice recogniser and this has multi purpose use it can be used for t v it can be used for cable satellites it can be used for v c r d v d s and audio
[ 584.88- 585.28] FIE088: ok
[ 595.20- 597.66] FIO087: and this has inbuilt voice recogniser
[ 601.64- 620.24] FIO087: can you move to the next slide yeah now this is an interface for a child for a remote which a child can use this is user friendly it is very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it and this comes with different colors different shapes
[ 630.00- 637.24] FIO087: buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
[ 638.14- 640.76] FIO087: attractive child interface
[ 646.56- 657.84] FIO087: excellent piece now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace it so well
[ 656.32- 659.98] FIO089: you do not know me
[ 660.00- 662.86] FIO089: i could lose that in a minute
[ 661.12- 672.48] FIO087: this is no this is a very big you cannot misplace it anywhere so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it is impossible to misplace or lose
[ 673.88- 676.48] FIO087: this is this is one such interface which can be creative
[ 678.36- 689.86] FIO087: and the personal preference would be a speed to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to users voice for a particular function
[ 690.56- 690.76] FIE088: right
[ 691.96- 692.76] FIO087: thank you that is it
[ 711.48- 716.80] FIE088: ok thank you very much any comments on her presentation
[ 720.36- 749.96] FIO089: well looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there what i am no suggestion is bad but we are going to have to narrow it down a little more i do not think that we can get the t shape is good the child one is good the too big to misplace i think is just funny i do not think that is going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter it is it is going to be a little bit too
[ 728.72- 728.96] FIO087: yeah
[ 740.40- 742.56] FIO087: ok yeah
[ 742.28- 744.08] FIE088: yeah i th i think
[ 747.80- 748.52] FIO087: yeah
[ 749.36- 750.00] FIE088: no i think
[ 750.00- 763.20] FIE088: see these are her presentations but as far as the decision making we getting to that after week after but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation
[ 750.00- 750.48] FIO089: wheel the
[ 751.60- 752.32] FIO089: yeah
[ 754.76- 756.62] FIO089: have to come back to that later ok
[ 755.64- 755.92] FIO087: yeah
[ 762.54- 766.68] FIO089: no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options
[ 764.18- 764.40] FIE088: right
[ 766.48- 769.46] FIE088: who wants to go next
[ 770.14- 770.70] FIO084: yeah maybe
[ 770.64- 772.20] FIE088: ok and you
[ 772.08- 772.82] FIO084: discipline too
[ 777.12- 777.78] FIE088: ok
[ 778.28- 780.00] FIO084: the next one so it is
[ 779.60- 780.00] FIE088: oops
[ 780.00- 781.22] FIO084: it is it is the one
[ 787.60- 789.96] FIE088: a components design ok
[ 787.60- 788.20] FIO084: can i
[ 796.98- 809.44] FIO084: this time i am i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote control design can you go on to the next slide please
[ 810.12- 824.18] FIO084: i have just briefed down a few components which we require for the remote control construction the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera etcetera it is like
[ 824.52- 839.94] FIO084: it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong even if you just you know if you if it falls down then it does not break so it should be strong and there are no harm
[ 840.00- 843.48] FIO084: ful materials used in that and it should be recyclable
[ 845.24- 858.24] FIO084: and yeah and also using of coloring compo compounds like if we want to have different colors blue red green so we have to use some coloring component component compounds
[ 845.72- 846.52] FIO089: that is a good point
[ 858.84- 870.00] FIO084: and the second important thing is integrated circuit we sh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the it is like the heart of the remote
[ 870.00- 899.96] FIO084: controller if it is not efficient then everything is going to be like m less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside it should it should be able to re resist the temperature high sun high temperature and low temperatures and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm sensor
[ 901.40- 923.60] FIO084: and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like it is very very much important for the electricity flow through through through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a which is a i think it is it is like a battery capacitor can you go on to the next slide please
[ 926.04- 929.98] FIO084: a diode a transistor a resonator
[ 930.12- 960.00] FIO084: these are all the s technical electro electronic compounds components which are which we have to use in a remote controller a battery i would like to suggest one thing if we if we will be able to make a re re chargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can not l it can not charge much it it it is not a high voltage battery then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use
[ 954.52- 954.88] FIE088: yeah
[ 960.00- 967.48] FIO084: it for a long time so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w in that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
[ 968.32- 978.48] FIO084: and we we have a circuit board in a remote control can we go to the next slide please and how it works how the remote control works when you press a button
[ 986.40- 989.98] FIO084: ok when you press a button when you do that you
[ 990.00-1017.70] FIO084: complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed it pro produces a more more score line signal specific to that button
[1020.00-1046.32] FIO084: button has its own morse code suppose the user has pressed button button one then it will have a sp the circuit will generate a specific morse code to that that button and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the l e d which translates the signal into infrared light like you have got a signal by pressing a button that is morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit
[1050.00-1080.00] FIO084: by the transistor that is use of transist transistor v which we use in remote control it will amplify signal and it will send it to l e d and which translates signal into an infra infrared bits sensor in t v can see infrared light and seeing signal seeing signal re it reacts appropriately that when it sees amplified mor morse code signal n it will it will know which what what action it has to do n it will do appropriate
[1078.92-1079.98] FIE088: yeah
[1079.56-1079.98] FIO087: yeah
[1080.00-1080.46] FIE088: tip
[1080.00-1084.06] FIO084: action so this is how the remote controller works
[1080.80-1081.08] FIO089: yes
[1086.08-1087.40] FIO084: can you go to the next slide please
[1088.18-1097.76] FIO084: yeah i have few pictures when you look at the remote controller it is it is it this is a normal remote controller and to the next slide please
[1099.16-1109.98] FIO084: and we had a few buttons and all and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit circuit board and few electronic components like you can see a chip there
[1110.00-1122.52] FIO084: which is having eighteen pins and also a capac a capacitor three resistors and also resonator yeah and di and the diode transistor
[1124.08-1131.64] FIO084: the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and diode transistors
[1134.12-1139.98] FIO084: yeah the can you you can see the t a double one eight three five labeled
[1140.00-1141.56] FIO084: shape
[1142.72-1163.84] FIO084: you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor and also there are resistors sorry th there is a diode can you go go on to the next
[1147.84-1148.12] FIO089: yes
[1164.56-1165.00] FIO087: yes
[1164.96-1169.98] FIO084: so this is the circuit board the green one is a circuit board actually building a circuit
[1170.00-1200.00] FIO084: go board is pretty pretty easy and also it is it is inexpensive it is it costs less than what you print on a paper because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires it is it is better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a on a bulk and it is just printing nothing like you know you do not need to use wires and all it is not exactly wires we are using it is just printing something
[1170.00-1170.28] FIO089: ok
[1195.30-1196.54] FIO089: that is interesting
[1200.00-1205.30] FIO084: ing on a board the those prints will act act as wires and cir circuits
[1206.68-1229.96] FIO084: so the that green thing is a circuit board and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button the circuit under the button will be activated it will it will have get some signals from it and it will it will ch it is ch send the signals signals to the in integrated circuit can we go to the next
[1212.84-1217.38] FIE088: ok you have more pictures we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
[1230.00-1230.68] FIO084: yeah
[1231.24-1239.04] FIO084: so this is these are the circuits and underneath the buttons can you see the black round marks they they are the circuits
[1239.96-1259.98] FIO084: excuse and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls but a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range
[1250.34-1251.12] FIE088: ok well thank you
[1252.48-1255.76] FIE088: any particular comments by anybody
[1256.48-1259.98] FIO089: yeah on the scroll and the push button can you
[1260.00-1285.82] FIO084: like for scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and c a a a f a full complete chip and a as energy source we offer a basic battery more ingenious a hard dynamo a kinetic provision of energy modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy so that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells
[1260.00-1262.76] FIO089: can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
[1278.32-1278.52] FIO089: yeah
[1281.10-1284.68] FIO089: we will just go for push buttons for in in interest of cost ok
[1284.96-1288.92] FIE088: we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present
[1287.32-1287.60] FIO084: yeah
[1290.00-1292.68] FIE088: inter thing
[1290.00-1301.64] FIO084: yeah the product can be d delivered into different cases usually the case is uncut flat that we we see usually a d a normal remote controller
[1291.16-1293.48] FIO089: ok and we are right to my first my next slide
[1293.80-1294.86] FIE088: ok
[1296.40-1319.96] FIO089: alright my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing and then when i am out in
[1303.56-1303.92] FIO084: yeah
[1306.72-1310.80] FIO084: yeah maybe i have just one more slide i think
[1312.16-1319.96] FIO084: like we can have m material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can not use and also for electronic
[1312.40-1313.10] FIO087: we have pushed it down
[1320.00-1335.92] FIO084: so we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print also infra it includes the infrared sender yeah and for the movie just to j develop a sample sensor speak sample speaker
[1320.00-1350.00] FIO089: people is houses or meetings or anything like that i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it is convenient the conversation i ask about it and i would encourage you all to do the same and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful people like something that really fits in their hand simple is beautiful they do not want to have to squint at small print they want buttons whose functions are obvious and they want as few buttons
[1337.16-1340.28] FIE088: ok that
[1337.16-1338.30] FIO084: yeah that is it
[1339.22-1340.42] FIO084: it is all for me now thank you
[1342.00-1350.00] FIE088: concludes the presentation of everyone and what we really have to s decide in this meeting is
[1350.00-1352.02] FIE088: the concept of the remote
[1350.00-1379.98] FIO089: as possible and they do not care for the mode thing they want each button to do something and eye catching is important it has got to look cute it has got to look appealing go ahead i am trying to finish fast for you and our preference is as far as i am concerned or we have got to get to the market before the competition ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item and we should develop one
[1353.52-1374.38] FIO084: no no no the the the scrolling was different like you can go for s switches like buttons or scrolls which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think now nobody uses it because you need you need a a a sophisticated chip and all so i think it is better we go for ordinary buttons yeah yeah yeah
[1353.62-1360.14] FIE088: and so what do we think on the concept
[1361.12-1361.94] FIE088: of the remote
[1372.44-1374.46] FIE088: ok
[1380.00-1409.96] FIO089: or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign if we try to sell people that has too many great features the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere so we have got to narrow our selection down to b two things i think that we are going to say are really great about our our our new product and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular and people are
[1383.68-1384.52] FIE088: i think that is
[1397.64-1401.84] FIO087: yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser
[1406.56-1409.12] FIE088: well you you teach you have to teach
[1410.00-1418.96] FIE088: ok before we get too far off here the components of the concept is the energy what kind of energy do we foresee
[1410.00-1412.54] FIO087: this could be a one feature which could be sellable
[1410.00-1424.70] FIO089: tired of hard plastic and hard metal they are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them so those are things maybe we want to look at as far as saleability of the item
[1420.60-1422.20] FIE088: battery battery
[1426.98-1429.28] FIE088: ok then chip on print
[1430.48-1437.56] FIE088: ok and the case and i think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright colorful
[1441.20-1469.98] FIO087: no it is it is yeah it is it is like you are recording a all a question already and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a t v system i am the user and my family members are the user i will already record a a question like good morning like around eight o clock i want to see the news in the television so i will say just good morning and the t v will switch on it will recognize my voice and it will switch on
[1444.80-1447.40] FIE088: trendy design compact and strong
[1450.28-1456.44] FIE088: user interface concept interface type supplements
[1455.18-1458.96] FIO089: you want to try to come back to your zone and limit your zone
[1459.60-1462.52] FIE088: l p u r area i think right yeah
[1462.20-1462.52] FIO089: ok
[1466.32-1469.44] FIO089: so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned
[1469.50-1469.80] FIO084: well
[1469.52-1469.98] FIE088: p o it
[1470.00-1472.28] FIE088: but i guess for yeah
[1470.00-1470.28] FIO087: chap
[1472.76-1477.92] FIO089: yeah that could that could that could be our star feature that that might be really good yeah i agree with that
[1473.52-1473.74] FIO084: yeah
[1475.20-1476.06] FIE088: and
[1476.82-1488.08] FIO084: yeah but but but i am very very much doubtful how how far it will work because speech recognizer like it it has its own problems issues
[1477.22-1479.18] FIE088: i am not sure what they mean by supplements
[1481.84-1482.04] FIO087: yeah
[1483.16-1483.68] FIE088: oh like
[1483.76-1484.08] FIO087: yeah
[1484.92-1485.28] FIE088: oh
[1487.02-1489.24] FIE088: oh right right by supplement
[1487.14-1488.16] FIO089: distance problem
[1488.08-1497.44] FIO084: yeah it is not distance problem it it is recognizing a person is voice like maybe different people will be having different voices so like it is everything so it
[1489.98-1490.32] FIO087: yes
[1494.84-1495.28] FIO089: yeah
[1497.40-1497.90] FIE088: right
[1498.76-1499.92] FIO084: so to get a good
[1498.80-1499.70] FIO087: and gone back
[1500.00-1503.24] FIO084: recognis recognizing system it is a cost rating item
[1501.18-1502.90] FIO087: friendly design and compact
[1501.60-1516.84] FIE088: ok our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and the i d is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then to have the look and feel design
[1507.48-1507.92] FIO087: yes
[1510.36-1516.60] FIO089: i think i think battery and i think we all agreed on that that that is that is going to be most cost effective and the best thing
[1517.28-1518.14] FIO084: yeah but yeah
[1518.72-1527.24] FIE088: and the u i d is supposed to come up with the user interface design
[1519.78-1520.02] FIO089: yeah
[1528.16-1529.98] FIO089: bright colorful
[1528.48-1528.92] FIE088: and
[1528.84-1529.54] FIO087: push buttons
[1529.40-1529.70] FIO084: yeah
[1530.00-1548.08] FIE088: work with the product evaluation in this phase the two of you janna and franthine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay it says here you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coach
[1530.00-1532.28] FIO089: twenty trendy design and strong
[1537.88-1538.08] FIO087: i
[1539.78-1546.56] FIO087: supplement like different types of features buttons like you have a mute button or a overlapping button
[1544.36-1545.56] FIO084: yeah
[1548.38-1549.84] FIO087: it admits them yes
[1549.36-1549.76] FIO084: yeah
[1549.56-1559.98] FIE088: if you have any questions you know you you can always contact me or or your coach i suppose
[1557.56-1557.96] FIO087: yes
[1557.64-1558.08] FIO084: yeah
[1559.12-1559.96] FIO084: but it is
[1560.00-1573.96] FIE088: so i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes according to our time table here
[1560.00-1560.20] FIO084: on
[1560.88-1562.04] FIO084: try
[1569.92-1570.60] FIO089: well i think it
[1572.64-1579.28] FIO089: yeah well well like her speech recognition would also be a supplement her speech recognition feature would be a supplement
[1577.52-1578.32] FIE088: thank you very much
[1580.08-1580.48] FIO084: or
[1580.12-1587.26] FIO089: ok so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
[1584.28-1588.86] FIO084: like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
[1590.00-1590.50] FIO084: buttons
[1598.76-1599.26] FIO087: ok
[1599.24-1599.46] FIO084: yeah
[1608.32-1608.88] FIO087: ok
[1616.32-1617.44] FIO084: spent if that is
[1622.36-1622.80] FIO089: ok
[1631.40-1631.76] FIO087: ok
[1638.36-1638.84] FIO087: thank you
[1651.36-1654.04] FIO089: where they are hiding

============================================================
SESSION: IS1009d
============================================================

[  39.40-  41.32] FIE088: well hi everyone again
[  41.28-  41.56] FIO087: no
[  41.82-  42.24] FIO089: hello
[  43.24-  54.40] FIE088: like before we i have to reuse the meetings from the n the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go
[  55.92-  60.00] FIE088: it was discussed in the last meeting which was open
[  60.00-  64.64] FIE088: by the presentation from the interface
[  65.64-  66.88] FIO087: designer
[  65.68-  89.80] FIE088: designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the t v it should have nine channel buttons a next button volume buttons subtitle buttons switch to control features color contrast sharpness et cetera
[  90.20- 107.78] FIE088: for the memory switch mute button in case the telephone rings or something speech recognition is one of her very f favorite personal features she would like see to to to to be integrated in this in this new remote
[ 111.92- 119.98] FIE088: should be child friendly design with few buttons colorful maybe with star shaped or other shaped buttons
[ 120.00- 129.26] FIE088: she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
[ 130.36- 130.88] FIE088: i am sure she
[ 130.36- 135.06] FIO089: and she was challenged on that point
[ 132.38- 133.32] FIE088: that is right
[ 133.20- 134.56] FIO087: yes
[ 134.84- 149.98] FIE088: but her very fir personal favorite really she she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote the industrial designer presented her
[ 150.00- 164.38] FIE088: thoughts on the issue she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials should be recyclable and should be colorful
[ 165.64- 171.16] FIE088: should have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
[ 172.84- 179.96] FIE088: she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated in
[ 180.00- 191.44] FIE088: technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitator diode transistor resonator and if possible a rechargeable battery
[ 192.64- 194.72] FIE088: and of course a circuit board
[ 196.00- 209.96] FIE088: and how it would works you press the button the chip is morse morse code related relays the to the genera to the generator amplification and
[ 210.00- 220.00] FIE088: the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to to to consider
[ 215.46- 215.72] FIO089: ok
[ 222.16- 226.96] FIE088: she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
[ 228.04- 232.64] FIE088: scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
[ 233.84- 238.92] FIE088: should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases
[ 240.40- 262.72] FIE088: the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should should be small
[ 264.32- 266.52] FIE088: easy to use and it should be eye catching
[ 270.36- 277.48] FIE088: from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does
[ 280.60- 290.56] FIE088: to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
[ 292.12- 300.00] FIE088: too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really
[ 300.00- 301.48] FIE088: driven home
[ 302.86- 311.28] FIE088: it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that is really what people want today
[ 312.92- 320.96] FIE088: and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
[ 322.18- 330.00] FIE088: the energy should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong
[ 330.00- 331.88] FIE088: and and should have buttons
[ 333.24- 337.98] FIE088: and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
[ 340.72- 345.34] FIE088: now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
[ 347.24- 347.44] FIO084: yeah
[ 347.72- 351.12] FIO087: yeah does they look alike the button part i will explain
[ 351.32- 351.56] FIO084: yeah
[ 356.24- 360.00] FIO084: so this is what we have made this is a more
[ 360.00- 389.96] FIO084: of the remote controller which we are going to build this is a s in a snail shape so it it is attractive and it is it is blue in color bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons so it is a look wise it is beautiful and also compact in shape and also it it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all
[ 361.48- 362.98] FIO089: good
[ 366.84- 370.06] FIO089: you used to have all the buttons
[ 390.00- 391.28] FIO084: all the buttons easily
[ 392.28- 394.52] FIO089: oh that is good yeah that is us in french
[ 393.00- 396.64] FIO084: yeah
[ 400.24- 412.76] FIO084: yeah and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which which is strong and also for the
[ 418.92- 419.98] FIO087: ok not
[ 420.00- 429.96] FIO084: soft rubber and those yeah yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it
[ 420.00- 439.58] FIO087: the we decided upon including certain features on our remote now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or led the infrared now we have included the switch on and off button
[ 430.40- 442.40] FIO084: and then for the for the led for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bu like an ordinary infrared
[ 432.88- 433.96] FIO089: yeah
[ 433.28- 434.36] FIE088: p d
[ 443.12- 447.04] FIO087: now we have included another feature that is the mute button
[ 444.12- 448.76] FIO084: and the button buttons part will be explained by f f asina
[ 451.12- 457.66] FIO087: on the side of the model then we have included one to nine buttons
[ 458.90- 461.90] FIO087: for controlling the programs the different channels
[ 467.52- 472.64] FIO087: we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
[ 480.00- 482.92] FIO087: calling up and scrolling down the program channels
[ 486.88- 491.38] FIO087: now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
[ 491.78- 492.52] FIE088: what kind of button
[ 492.58- 493.38] FIO087: menu button
[ 493.66- 496.00] FIE088: menu a menu a menu a one one
[ 494.16- 494.98] FIO087: menu
[ 494.40- 495.14] FIO089: menu button
[ 496.12- 496.96] FIO087: at the center
[ 498.36- 506.48] FIO087: we have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color sharpness brightness
[ 508.16- 509.68] FIO089: of the screen
[ 508.96- 510.00] FIO087: of the picture
[ 513.00- 517.08] FIO087: we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
[ 518.56- 523.80] FIO087: now this is a a special special feature which we have included now this button
[ 525.24- 539.16] FIO087: is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel
[ 540.46- 543.52] FIO087: it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a
[ 546.62- 547.56] FIO087: swapping button
[ 550.40- 554.12] FIO089: the next channel in the numeric pattern or
[ 554.12- 564.56] FIO087: no swapping is if if for example you are you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap this button yes
[ 557.78- 558.32] FIO089: yeah
[ 563.76- 564.84] FIO089: ok ok
[ 569.20- 570.00] FIO087: and at the end
[ 570.00- 579.02] FIO087: and this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which which will recognize the user is voice and then it will act according
[ 582.52- 583.08] FIE088: no
[ 584.76- 589.86] FIO087: so this is a proposed model now the marketing expert has to
[ 584.88- 585.32] FIO089: ok
[ 591.20- 597.96] FIO087: give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective
[ 598.20- 599.82] FIO089: ok well
[ 601.12- 612.60] FIO089: whan what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb that you can really hold it in one hand you do not need two hands and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah
[ 605.32- 606.28] FIO087: yes yes
[ 612.80- 614.80] FIE088: yes the buttons are all raised right
[ 615.12- 630.00] FIO089: the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that you really did a good job on that my little designers
[ 615.26- 615.44] FIO087: yeah
[ 615.68- 616.52] FIE088: raised
[ 619.68- 620.04] FIE088: right
[ 620.32- 621.28] FIO084: ten
[ 623.16- 625.22] FIE088: or have two hands to operate it yeah
[ 630.00- 641.16] FIO089: and i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place that is that is a really good good thing
[ 640.80- 648.08] FIE088: yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you do not have to first go like oh yeah here it is on and yeah
[ 642.20- 643.48] FIO089: yeah that is great
[ 646.84- 647.88] FIO087: yeah
[ 647.88- 656.32] FIO089: the color is very attractive the these buttons around here are the mute
[ 657.46- 660.00] FIO087: no these the front buttons which are here
[ 657.60- 659.92] FIO089: and these
[ 660.00- 663.24] FIO087: the are the mute buttons yes yes
[ 661.60- 665.60] FIO089: on both sides of it so you can push either one ok
[ 664.40- 664.82] FIO087: yes
[ 665.70- 668.06] FIE088: so if you are left handed or right handed it does not matter
[ 667.00- 673.80] FIO089: and this brings the menu up on the screen this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
[ 669.16- 669.48] FIO087: pardon me
[ 669.86- 671.48] FIO087: this is the menu yes yes
[ 674.04- 682.60] FIO087: the the these these two are the to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to scroll the program channels
[ 678.12- 678.60] FIO089: ok
[ 682.12- 684.88] FIO089: ok so ok very very good
[ 684.08- 685.68] FIO087: scroll up or scroll down the channel
[ 685.88- 688.40] FIO089: it looks that looks like something i could sell
[ 691.04- 694.10] FIO089: ok and now i am supposed to yeah
[ 692.56- 703.80] FIE088: well i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
[ 703.84- 712.00] FIO087: yes it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols yes which can be easily written nice
[ 709.32- 714.40] FIE088: will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know it does not have to learn
[ 710.48- 710.64] FIO089: yeah
[ 712.92- 713.28] FIO087: yes
[ 713.72- 719.72] FIO089: good point because we need the symbols cause we are going into an international market we can not have anything that is language dependent
[ 714.72- 715.12] FIO087: yes
[ 717.96- 718.20] FIO087: yeah
[ 718.92- 720.00] FIE088: yeah but
[ 719.88- 719.98] FIO087: it
[ 720.00- 726.12] FIE088: anyway it would h it it has to have some kind of of text or something for that people
[ 723.56- 725.44] FIO089: simple ones
[ 724.68- 725.18] FIO087: yes
[ 727.68- 728.16] FIO087: yes
[ 727.72- 728.04] FIE088: that is right
[ 729.24- 731.56] FIE088: ok yeah just want to make sure of that
[ 730.04- 730.38] FIO087: and
[ 731.28- 738.08] FIO087: and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape a shell shape
[ 735.24- 736.04] FIO084: that is different
[ 738.56- 749.98] FIO089: for the snail we have the snail shell he goes right back into his shell well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we
[ 739.28- 740.00] FIE088: right
[ 739.28- 740.24] FIO087: right yes
[ 740.52- 741.58] FIO084: that that
[ 740.96- 743.32] FIO087: yeah snail shell yes
[ 741.00- 741.12] FIE088: yeah
[ 742.44- 742.96] FIO084: yeah
[ 743.28- 743.56] FIE088: right
[ 743.56- 743.88] FIO084: so
[ 746.14- 747.52] FIO084: yeah that is not so
[ 750.00- 760.64] FIO089: could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would that would really work so
[ 751.60- 752.50] FIO084: yeah yeah
[ 753.88- 754.32] FIO084: text
[ 755.42- 761.32] FIO084: text that we can have on the case itself we it will be printed on the case and simple so yeah
[ 756.80- 758.12] FIO087: yeah
[ 760.04- 767.14] FIE088: now what what are our special features for the marketing that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
[ 766.32- 772.56] FIO089: i think voice recognition is our big selling point cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range
[ 769.44- 773.18] FIO084: yes so it should have snail shell yeah shell
[ 772.76- 779.36] FIE088: and then and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use
[ 779.82- 780.00] FIO089: yeah
[ 780.00- 793.32] FIO089: well i think that everybody is going to say their remote control is practical i think we have to we have to dwell on on on the appearance you are really going to have the beth the
[ 781.08- 781.60] FIE088: you know
[ 787.04- 787.84] FIE088: colors
[ 787.64- 789.20] FIO084: yeah
[ 794.16- 794.64] FIE088: cute
[ 794.44- 807.60] FIO089: cutest remote control on the block so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the look
[ 796.94- 797.10] FIE088: yeah
[ 808.96- 810.00] FIO089: and the voice recognition
[ 810.00- 811.84] FIO089: and they are going to be our two selling points
[ 812.92- 815.58] FIE088: ok now having said that
[ 815.56- 817.60] FIO089: i am supposed to make a little presentation on it
[ 818.64- 825.76] FIE088: no no this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done now we are going to talk about financing
[ 821.40- 822.44] FIO089: ok
[ 826.62- 832.76] FIO089: but in my instructions i think it is not always supposed to go to the board and do something no
[ 832.78- 834.84] FIE088: well there is a production evaluation study or
[ 835.16- 835.66] FIO089: yeah that is me
[ 836.04- 839.30] FIE088: but that is after the financing ok fine you see
[ 837.44- 840.00] FIO089: oh ok so are we so are we
[ 840.00- 840.88] FIO089: no
[ 845.74- 864.40] FIE088: ok we had looks and voice recognition ok now on the fine end thing we bring up the there it is ok energy source we say that is battery right
[ 865.56- 865.98] FIO089: that is right
[ 866.36- 867.62] FIE088: ok now
[ 870.84- 872.80] FIE088: so we i guess we use one
[ 874.16- 874.60] FIO087: yes
[ 876.02- 876.44] FIE088: what
[ 879.84- 884.44] FIE088: the solar charge we were trying to change the proctecti oh that is nice
[ 885.30- 888.02] FIE088: you told me i could just change it here and then it would
[ 889.12- 889.84] FIE088: does not work
[ 894.76- 897.28] FIO089: can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes or
[ 897.32- 900.00] FIE088: oh ok yeah ok let us see
[ 899.84- 900.00] FIO087: ok
[ 900.00- 914.32] FIE088: ok one ok i will go away kinetic source so that is in the energy source that is all we need electronic simple chip on print is that what we are using one of those
[ 903.74- 904.04] FIO084: yeah
[ 912.52- 912.68] FIO087: yeah
[ 915.60- 921.56] FIE088: come on ok one regular chip on print no
[ 922.86- 928.60] FIE088: that is all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
[ 927.88- 928.42] FIO084: yeah
[ 929.76- 930.00] FIO089: oh
[ 930.00- 931.14] FIO089: oh
[ 933.60- 934.80] FIO087: single color
[ 935.34- 936.72] FIO089: i guess it is double curved
[ 937.04- 939.36] FIE088: double curved one of those
[ 942.24- 946.44] FIE088: case materials supplements plastic we said right
[ 942.40- 943.52] FIO084: yeah yeah
[ 946.18- 946.78] FIO087: plastic
[ 948.26- 949.62] FIE088: wood rubber
[ 949.76- 951.64] FIO089: remember because we are going to have the soft buttons
[ 952.52- 952.80] FIO084: no
[ 952.68- 954.30] FIE088: but yes but
[ 953.70- 954.06] FIO084: ok
[ 957.22- 959.98] FIE088: that is just for the case materials so
[ 958.80- 959.98] FIO087: it is too late
[ 959.36- 960.00] FIO089: oh ok
[ 960.00- 962.64] FIE088: special color so we are having that right
[ 960.00- 960.82] FIO089: s ok
[ 962.76- 963.44] FIO084: this is
[ 962.80- 963.28] FIO087: yes
[ 965.08- 969.02] FIE088: and then we have the interface push buttons
[ 969.16- 969.64] FIO087: yes
[ 973.68- 977.70] FIE088: scroll wheel no integrated scroll wheel l c display
[ 975.72- 976.04] FIO084: send
[ 977.96- 981.04] FIO089: no cause we did not put the clock in it after all
[ 978.24- 978.60] FIO087: no
[ 979.18- 979.96] FIE088: buttons
[ 980.08- 980.38] FIO084: yeah
[ 981.62- 981.92] FIE088: no
[ 983.20- 985.32] FIE088: buttons up them in special color
[ 983.48- 984.24] FIO087: special
[ 985.00- 989.36] FIO084: i think that is for for rubber there is a a piece too
[ 985.52- 985.92] FIO087: yes
[ 987.68- 988.56] FIE088: special form
[ 989.30- 990.00] FIO087: yes
[ 989.64- 990.00] FIO089: yes
[ 990.00- 991.28] FIO087: we do have a special point
[ 992.76- 995.52] FIE088: and special material rubber wood yes
[ 992.78- 993.40] FIO084: yes
[ 997.26- 997.84] FIE088: ok
[1001.74-1004.16] FIE088: total seven point six whatever that means
[1006.64-1007.82] FIE088: that is the price
[1006.68-1009.48] FIO087: this is the price
[1010.80-1012.36] FIE088: eight eight point two
[1011.72-1011.96] FIO084: no
[1016.64-1018.92] FIO087: nine points ok yes
[1016.84-1018.24] FIE088: that is
[1020.00-1020.56] FIE088: two right
[1022.36-1024.26] FIE088: so we looks like we are
[1025.64-1026.56] FIE088: well within budget
[1027.00-1027.44] FIO087: ok
[1027.84-1028.40] FIE088: ok
[1030.92-1032.72] FIE088: yes i should save this i suppose yeah
[1032.92-1033.24] FIO089: yeah
[1035.32-1037.62] FIO084: i think that is the pr i think that is
[1038.98-1039.36] FIE088: right
[1039.16-1040.42] FIO084: maybe you these are just
[1054.98-1055.98] FIO087: in the desktop
[1056.60-1061.44] FIE088: i just tried that i do not think it is computer no i do not think it is
[1066.84-1068.92] FIE088: kay fine sorry
[1071.40-1079.80] FIE088: ok good so that is the good news we are going to be popular
[1081.64-1084.24] FIE088: so that i think financing was pretty simple
[1085.36-1091.64] FIE088: now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
[1089.84-1091.00] FIO084: i am a sheep
[1092.16-1094.48] FIO089: ok i will take my file down so you can bring it up
[1107.92-1108.88] FIO089: kay should be able to get it
[1112.72-1115.02] FIO089: kay why do not you move just to the next slide right away
[1116.00-1118.00] FIE088: you want to go to the next slide ok
[1116.88-1140.00] FIO089: yeah ok well obviously my method for s the marketing of this thing is first ask the big question will it sell and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we have not thought of we can not accept every suggestion of
[1135.36-1135.88] FIO087: ok
[1140.00-1165.36] FIO089: course but maybe we just need to get a few and show the the prototype to consumer research groups we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we will not sell any so we have to get some input from those people and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it we think it is good we are going to get behind it and sell it next slide please
[1167.00-1167.44] FIO084: yeah
[1167.80-1169.98] FIO089: ok now the things that i
[1170.00-1199.98] FIO089: was thinking and that my wish list has really been realized in this prototype i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i did not want anything with angles and all square i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we got that size is small the color is bright and warm which is what we wanted we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped even though it is going to be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that is nice and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to use
[1180.80-1184.08] FIO087: s
[1200.00-1230.00] FIO089: is it before they buy it so paradoxically the other features in other words the look the feel and the shape that is what people are going to get in the store they do not have a television in the store they can not play with it so they will be our main selling points so those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please ok so the shape i think is a a one
[1221.80-1222.80] FIO087: ok
[1224.20-1230.00] FIE088: i just realize one thing in the financing there was no room
[1230.00-1231.80] FIE088: for our voice recognizer
[1230.00-1254.10] FIO089: that is really really excellent shape the size is small and these points are in the importance for the for the marketing these are not in how i feel i think that it is i think that it is plenty small enough to sell but i think we are sort of right the scale is one to seven i think we are sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors
[1234.28-1241.80] FIE088: and i do not know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that to
[1240.76-1241.16] FIO084: dor
[1243.40-1243.76] FIO084: yeah
[1245.54-1247.12] FIE088: eight eight twenty yes
[1251.16-1256.16] FIE088: i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty
[1254.56-1259.96] FIO089: and our color i think is great the colors are bright and warm and we really do a great job there and
[1260.00-1270.84] FIE088: of presenting that to management as you know as a finished as a finished product and saying ok with a voice recogniser that costs so much
[1260.00-1283.78] FIO089: and given the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible and then functionality i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have added added different functions but then we disturbed something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality so i think that basically we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it
[1262.50-1263.12] FIO087: yes
[1272.00-1280.84] FIE088: so we just have to be aware of that i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that
[1287.48-1287.84] FIO089: yes
[1292.64-1293.04] FIO089: yeah
[1299.86-1300.16] FIE088: yeah
[1301.44-1305.82] FIO089: well we had what eight eight euros twenty as our cost
[1304.88-1320.00] FIE088: i am sorry to interrupt that but i just recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not included that there was no room for any special features ok so the b v a are over there
[1307.30-1311.08] FIO089: and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend
[1316.00-1318.12] FIO089: well that is
[1320.00-1323.28] FIE088: that you want to go to this next slide am i getting it
[1322.50-1323.56] FIO087: yeah
[1323.32-1323.68] FIO084: yeah
[1325.40-1328.16] FIE088: i do not know yes it goes forward
[1336.76-1340.88] FIO084: twenty or something
[1341.50-1350.00] FIO089: well as we know in today is techni technological world you can do just about anything at any price so the the problem is quality so we are just going to
[1346.68-1346.96] FIE088: oh
[1347.28-1347.66] FIO087: yeah
[1350.00-1364.88] FIO089: have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway as we have seen with so many of these kind of products
[1352.54-1354.28] FIE088: why why you ended that up
[1366.22-1367.36] FIE088: i think you can make it though
[1379.20-1379.72] FIO084: yeah
[1380.00-1383.12] FIO084: yeah yeah that is yeah
[1382.52-1389.42] FIO089: well i is not this my last slide yeah i think that was my last slide yeah
[1389.54-1390.32] FIO084: yeah
[1392.74-1393.64] FIO089: ok
[1395.04-1396.64] FIE088: yes i think shape is one
[1395.96-1405.88] FIO089: and i am supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard and we are supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you will put my last slide back up there
[1402.40-1403.46] FIO084: included yeah
[1407.56-1408.86] FIE088: you you gave it a four
[1408.18-1409.98] FIO089: i am sorry i
[1410.00-1412.42] FIO089: yeah take that
[1412.46-1413.88] FIE088: i do not know
[1415.16-1417.00] FIE088: i think that would give it at least a two
[1416.12-1418.94] FIO089: well because i can not remember what i put on there
[1418.48-1419.32] FIO087: yeah ok
[1422.00-1422.30] FIO087: but
[1422.42-1426.12] FIO089: kay now i am supposed to see how long my leash is here
[1427.60-1428.52] FIO089: ok
[1429.36-1437.88] FIO089: alright so now we are all supposed to say what we think ok so on shape
[1435.96-1436.90] FIE088: color i
[1438.08-1438.40] FIE088: one
[1439.88-1440.00] FIE088: i
[1440.00-1441.96] FIE088: i i like the colors one
[1442.28-1443.40] FIO089: i gave it a one
[1444.80-1454.96] FIO089: w what would you r one being good and seven being the worst what do you think the shape is one ok and that is it
[1449.76-1450.08] FIO087: one
[1456.84-1462.74] FIO089: ok and ok and how about on size
[1457.76-1459.72] FIE088: i think i will give it a two
[1466.76-1467.80] FIO089: on size
[1468.64-1469.96] FIO089: i gave it a four yeah i feel like it is
[1470.00-1471.78] FIO089: it is just average
[1471.22-1472.20] FIO087: one
[1477.16-1477.68] FIO089: ok
[1479.22-1487.84] FIE088: well it is also you can not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but
[1483.38-1493.24] FIO089: ok ok you are the designer of course you want to do it anyway and then how about how are we doing on color
[1486.66-1489.36] FIO084: yeah even like yeah should be fine
[1490.88-1492.04] FIE088: i will give it a three
[1493.04-1493.80] FIO087: i will give three
[1496.68-1499.98] FIO089: color i gave it a one i really like almost not a sprite one
[1500.00-1500.58] FIO089: colors
[1501.84-1502.32] FIO089: one
[1504.06-1508.40] FIO089: one one one ok and how about the feel
[1511.26-1516.80] FIO089: taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand
[1511.76-1514.40] FIO084: yeah even i think it is one it is way too small
[1520.52-1524.64] FIO089: ok i give it a three two three
[1526.28-1526.40] FIO087: do
[1526.88-1527.88] FIO089: two ok
[1529.20-1530.00] FIO089: and
[1530.00-1536.74] FIO089: the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here but
[1532.66-1533.42] FIO084: yeah one
[1541.88-1542.40] FIO089: yeah
[1545.00-1545.50] FIO089: so
[1547.64-1554.16] FIE088: here is what we are looking at satisfaction for example room for creativity
[1552.22-1553.40] FIO089: ok
[1555.70-1557.56] FIO084: maybe two yeah
[1556.84-1557.76] FIO089: two ok
[1559.56-1559.98] FIO089: three
[1559.82-1560.00] FIE088: is
[1560.00-1563.92] FIE088: there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
[1562.00-1562.64] FIO089: ok
[1564.32-1565.56] FIO089: well
[1568.04-1589.10] FIO089: it looks like we have gotten got ourselves a pretty good product the functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having a meeting but otherwise i think we are we are ready to go to go with this product
[1588.68-1590.00] FIO084: three
[1590.68-1595.02] FIO089: anybody else have any other comments or any other things that you feel that we should evaluate
[1595.36-1597.24] FIO087: we can always improve yes
[1598.70-1599.78] FIO087: yes features
[1624.80-1625.36] FIO087: yes
[1627.26-1627.92] FIO087: oh i see
[1628.58-1649.96] FIE088: yeah i am always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can not with this particular item we probably can not just add a whole lot of more things we need the you know we need to leave space
[1633.92-1634.48] FIO087: yes
[1635.76-1635.98] FIO087: yeah
[1644.46-1644.80] FIO089: right
[1646.42-1650.00] FIO089: well then again if we are going to do the speech or
[1650.00-1653.92] FIE088: s money wise for the voice recogniser
[1650.00-1672.92] FIO089: recognition thing where there are going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added to that for the recording of the the speech so that that is where we are going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons and then maybe we can do something with the
[1655.34-1655.96] FIO084: yeah we can
[1656.84-1674.60] FIO084: yeah include some more buttons and yeah features we can make the buttons few buttons smaller i think they are quite big so i think i i mean we c we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case if we want to have more features in that
[1659.04-1660.48] FIO087: oh oh maybe
[1659.84-1676.56] FIE088: so the the question really is how do we feel with the project process are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created
[1674.24-1677.88] FIO089: the volume control maybe we can put that all on one button
[1678.04-1680.00] FIE088: i think personally i think
[1680.00-1681.44] FIE088: i am pretty happy
[1680.00-1688.04] FIO089: and a couple of other maybe comp consolidate some of the usage and and see what we can do with that
[1681.20-1681.52] FIO084: yeah
[1682.60-1684.00] FIE088: and
[1684.04-1685.16] FIO084: yeah definitely
[1686.12-1692.76] FIE088: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
[1692.84-1693.16] FIO089: ok
[1693.40-1696.62] FIO084: yeah that makes yeah too many big buttons
[1695.88-1701.68] FIE088: and i think teamwork i think was very very good i think we really worked
[1702.92-1703.28] FIO089: no
[1704.00-1709.96] FIE088: and i think we are we happy with the means we used we used whiteboard
[1710.00-1713.14] FIE088: word we did not use digital pen well digital pens i guess are these things
[1717.44-1732.00] FIE088: yes we could it is maybe not in the best position in the room you know like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit
[1724.00-1726.68] FIO087: yes yeah definitely yeah
[1733.98-1734.38] FIO084: yeah
[1734.12-1740.00] FIE088: yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a leave
[1740.00-1745.26] FIE088: is here did we knew did we find new ideas i think we did
[1741.68-1745.98] FIO089: i am pretty happy with the training now that is something i think i can market yeah
[1744.92-1747.84] FIO087: but it would be yeah it is a
[1747.28-1754.70] FIE088: i think we we did in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here
[1752.72-1756.96] FIO089: well i think you have done a good job this leader
[1757.20-1768.60] FIE088: are the costs within budget yes yes is the project evaluated yes
[1759.80-1763.02] FIO089: yeah i think are you two at the group we are brought together as a team you know
[1772.48-1773.32] FIO084: either end or
[1773.22-1778.10] FIO089: maybe we could have used the white board a little bit more we do not want to use that now
[1774.64-1781.54] FIE088: so i i thank you all very much i think this was very good and
[1775.24-1775.52] FIO084: yeah
[1782.72-1790.84] FIE088: i think we did come up with a new product that is feasible feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view
[1784.38-1786.46] FIO084: yeah it makes sense definitely makes sense yeah
[1790.04-1790.36] FIO084: yeah
[1791.04-1791.36] FIO084: yeah
[1792.04-1794.20] FIO089: and we used the slide because it was better positioned
[1792.80-1794.12] FIE088: so thank you
[1794.96-1798.48] FIO087: yeah
[1795.36-1796.70] FIO089: yeah so that is true
[1804.20-1806.56] FIE088: i know it is getting on here and like getting it off is
[1805.48-1808.00] FIO089: i think we were we were very good at that
[1806.36-1807.56] FIO084: yeah
[1814.80-1816.16] FIE088: so we have time
[1816.52-1816.74] FIO089: ok
[1821.90-1822.60] FIO089: yes yes

[  65.60-  89.98] MTD009PM: first i will tell you a little bit about the setting you can see the few cameras here they will record our actions and you all have voice and microphones they will record your voice there are also some microphones there but you do not have to pay a lot of attention on those because it will disappear when you do not attend to it
[  90.00- 101.44] MTD009PM: so this is our project documents folder there are some notes in it already i see documents i will start with the presentation kick off
[ 106.88- 113.74] MTD009PM: it is being modified by the administrator ok if you remember
[ 111.32- 113.52] MTD012ME: that is a good question
[ 116.66- 119.98] MTD009PM: well i do not know if you have noticed but
[ 120.00- 138.64] MTD009PM: we are working for real reaction it is a company in electronics we did fashion electronics we make it work we put a lot of effort in designing the the product itself and by the way i am the project manager so i will direct you through the project
[ 140.64- 141.76] MTD009PM: this is our agenda
[ 143.40- 147.72] MTD009PM: we have our open management tool training and project plan discussion closing
[ 149.68- 150.00] MTD009PM: and
[ 150.00- 159.02] MTD009PM: maybe i can sit down and i can take some notes or let us see
[ 161.34- 179.96] MTD009PM: maybe you can take the manage next time i do not know it is not a lot of work but just if you have something you can write down just write it back as you can see it is the opening quaintness tool training quaintness is a point we have done a bit have you also
[ 163.72- 164.00] MTD012ME: sure
[ 180.00- 190.52] MTD009PM: seen the corporate website already have you seen any flaws in it i think i found one no
[ 182.44- 183.52] MTD012ME: yep that is it
[ 190.88- 192.64] MTD012ME: can not say a bit much attention to it but
[ 193.52- 193.96] MTD009PM: ok
[ 196.08- 209.80] MTD009PM: see if it works this way no does not work here ok no problem but on the corporate information side there is the there was real
[ 210.00- 239.00] MTD009PM: instead of real reaction real remote is not really the company we we are but ok what are we going to do our project aim is as you can see a new remote control and as the original trendy and user friendly so these are the points why we also hired you we have got mark and he is going to be the one to do the remote control
[ 212.16- 212.68] MTD012ME: oh yeah
[ 227.20- 227.32] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 238.30- 238.60] MTD012ME: ok
[ 240.00- 252.12] MTD009PM: acting expert for the trendy and user friendly look and industrial designer that is also user friendly and a bit original
[ 253.40- 258.96] MTD009PM: and we have got our user interface designer so so
[ 260.36- 262.06] MTD009PM: that is about the new remote control
[ 263.16- 269.98] MTD009PM: project method is the there are three phases we are going
[ 270.00- 279.92] MTD009PM: through first is functional design individual work meetings after the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
[ 281.24- 286.84] MTD009PM: i had some little indications on here
[ 288.18- 300.00] MTD009PM: but i think you know it already by yourself the industrial designer is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look and feel design
[ 300.00- 328.16] MTD009PM: the user interface designers go to the technical function design user interface concept and user interface design and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements specification trend watching and project product ev evaluation so that is a bit what you are going to do but that will be all worked out in other meetings
[ 332.18- 359.98] MTD009PM: then we have got our first tool training we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it is it is handy if we have a little bit of training first as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here and the white board in the white board here is a little toolbar and on this side here are some functions we can save these functions we do not have anything
[ 360.00- 362.50] MTD009PM: do it only undo you can undo a little
[ 363.92- 389.92] MTD009PM: a piece of drawing a blank new document for each person select a pen eraser capture we do not have to do anything with then we have got our pen this pen it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the i think it is four mode you can also
[ 380.20- 380.66] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 390.00- 408.72] MTD009PM: select the current color and the line width but then first you have to select the pen function which we are going to work with in in a minute ok that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings in there
[ 405.26- 405.64] MTD011UID: ok
[ 410.00- 410.80] MTD009PM: then
[ 412.40- 419.96] MTD009PM: a short thing about documents we have got our shared folder project project what was it project
[ 420.00- 436.96] MTD009PM: documents so i think but all you all found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be ok and these are available on smart boards as well so if you have a document you want to show just open it from the folder
[ 439.40- 449.48] MTD009PM: here is the simple tool work it is for the just save print move back or forward one page you can switch between the different columns
[ 452.64- 454.80] MTD009PM: and then we are going to try out the whiteboard
[ 456.80- 469.34] MTD009PM: so as you can see we are going we are going to draw an animal just to just to get a bit familiar with mouse business running away
[ 469.28- 470.06] MTD012ME: oh
[ 471.32- 477.20] MTD009PM: so everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ok we are going to draw an animal
[ 475.30- 475.76] MTD012ME: yes
[ 476.20- 476.56] MTD011UID: ok
[ 478.30- 480.00] MTD009PM: and just
[ 480.00- 508.00] MTD009PM: up a few of its favorite characteristics the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different line width this i can start from now you can use this pen by holding it like like a little child because if you hold it like this the sensors will get blocked and the going will not get good
[ 506.74- 506.92] MTD012ME: kay
[ 509.30- 509.96] MTD009PM: another thing is
[ 509.80- 509.96] MTD011UID: s
[ 510.00- 539.96] MTD009PM: you have to be a bit slow as if you got me to draw really fast then then you want to hold up so we choose format current color i think gray is appropriate then alignment eight seven will be nice now you will see my drawing capabilities it is not very good
[ 510.00- 510.20] MTD011UID: or
[ 519.88- 520.64] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 523.84- 525.16] MTD0010ID: right
[ 540.00- 541.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 543.60- 545.80] MTD009PM: yeah you have to go real slow
[ 547.62- 548.92] MTD012ME: well thinking about a sort of thing
[ 554.36- 555.36] MTD009PM: oh that is a good idea
[ 571.12- 578.00] MTD009PM: it is trying to draw a dolphin i think it is not so easy to draw it it is going to
[ 579.62- 583.32] MTD009PM: sort yeah it is because it is a bit of a sort of a little eye
[ 584.96- 591.96] MTD009PM: well now we have got another function you can erase it and then you can undo
[ 593.56- 595.76] MTD009PM: this easily
[ 596.84- 600.00] MTD009PM: that is ok i will go through
[ 600.00- 606.90] MTD009PM: write down a few of his characteristics
[ 604.00- 605.40] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 612.42- 614.68] MTD009PM: we have got no text tool no
[ 617.56- 617.72] MTD009PM: oh
[ 629.52- 629.98] MTD009PM: ok
[ 630.00- 637.60] MTD009PM: this is typically a zoom action i think ok
[ 639.88- 641.08] MTD009PM: maybe you have to hold it a bit
[ 643.00- 653.20] MTD009PM: i think that is it because if you want to do this then you have to strike i do not know just try
[ 645.00- 645.28] MTD011UID: ok
[ 658.44- 659.98] MTD009PM: it is not mine
[ 660.00- 663.00] MTD009PM: ok maybe it is useful
[ 670.80- 671.26] MTD009PM: ok
[ 674.56- 675.04] MTD012ME: ok
[ 682.06- 682.48] MTD012ME: ok
[ 684.36- 686.28] MTD012ME: ok
[ 684.58- 689.80] MTD009PM: i think it is nice to draw a an array or i do not know
[ 691.28- 692.50] MTD012ME: we will use a different light then
[ 691.56- 693.20] MTD009PM: this was
[ 694.64- 696.12] MTD012ME: we are going to draw a blank
[ 694.96- 695.44] MTD009PM: sorry
[ 699.64- 705.84] MTD012ME: yeah ok not much in the lightest but here you go
[ 700.24- 714.08] MTD009PM: my characteristic my characteristic about the dog lives with the so now i am going to hand over the pen and the game play sheet to you go ahead
[ 707.04- 707.48] MTD011UID: pushy
[ 743.56- 750.00] MTD009PM: maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line width i think because this is going a little bit in
[ 750.00- 751.26] MTD009PM: no i did
[ 773.96- 778.32] MTD012ME: ok this is my
[ 782.20- 782.60] MTD012ME: sheet
[ 790.48- 791.64] MTD012ME: five dollars
[ 799.92- 803.20] MTD012ME: no blue dot they must get sprayed on their butt
[ 805.08- 805.66] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 806.52- 807.40] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 813.56- 813.80] MTD012ME: ok
[ 816.48- 816.92] MTD012ME: they are
[ 818.22- 819.84] MTD009PM: it is a nice
[ 819.36- 819.76] MTD012ME: ok
[ 828.80- 830.48] MTD012ME: it is going really slow this little plane
[ 829.60- 835.88] MTD011UID: ok just going to draw it is head
[ 835.00- 839.98] MTD009PM: it is a real dutchy recognition yeah i see
[ 837.90- 838.38] MTD011UID: let us see
[ 840.00- 840.80] MTD009PM: ok
[ 843.08- 846.24] MTD009PM: maybe you can also write your name somewhere just
[ 843.08- 843.22] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 849.44- 853.18] MTD012ME: they are really not animals and that is just a little thing
[ 854.44- 854.76] MTD012ME: so
[ 855.20- 855.56] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 858.56- 861.92] MTD012ME: so pass it on to our new hand to finish the job
[ 861.60- 862.42] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 889.80- 890.20] MTD009PM: right
[ 905.88- 907.52] MTD011UID: ok
[ 911.52- 913.52] MTD011UID: yeah do you know what that is
[ 915.72- 916.32] MTD0010ID: garfield
[ 916.48- 917.60] MTD011UID: i do not feel that
[ 918.48- 918.82] MTD011UID: yes
[ 923.16- 924.30] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 926.52- 927.76] MTD011UID: so
[ 930.16- 931.54] MTD011UID: yeah so
[ 933.06- 935.20] MTD011UID: use a laptop
[ 936.40- 937.04] MTD011UID: ok
[ 938.52- 938.92] MTD012ME: interesting
[ 945.50- 947.60] MTD012ME: or robo garfield yeah
[ 949.34- 960.00] MTD0010ID: well i was going to draw a cat too so let us try something else something different than
[ 960.00- 960.60] MTD0010ID: car field
[ 969.90- 972.28] MTD009PM: sweet
[ 979.82- 982.48] MTD0010ID: mine is a bit more skinny
[ 984.44- 985.42] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 994.96- 996.64] MTD009PM: yeah just think
[ 996.90-1001.18] MTD0010ID: well it is supposed to be a cat i like cats because of
[1004.08-1004.56] MTD0010ID: they are
[1007.52-1008.20] MTD0010ID: independent
[1015.68-1017.00] MTD012ME: that are most interesting to me
[1017.52-1017.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[1020.76-1021.08] MTD0010ID: so
[1041.12-1043.52] MTD009PM: yeah
[1048.56-1050.00] MTD009PM: is it your cat or did you find it
[1050.00-1052.84] MTD009PM: on the street
[1058.78-1059.20] MTD012ME: yeah
[1072.16-1073.00] MTD012ME: we are being confused
[1081.60-1096.80] MTD009PM: ok that is ok so everybody knows how to work the whiteboard now so if you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead yeah easy
[1100.92-1109.98] MTD009PM: hey so we are going to the whiteboard so we have got the tool introduction
[1110.00-1139.98] MTD009PM: move along to the project finance as you can see the for a remote control selling price is twenty five euros our selling price our profit aim is fifty million euros that is the least we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to reach our aims we can do it international
[1140.00-1151.40] MTD009PM: so we have to focus on different kind of users different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well but that is all in the later stadium
[1146.96-1148.00] MTD011UID: ok yeah
[1152.32-1169.98] MTD009PM: our production cost can be maximum twelve and a half euros so that is also a point we have to keep in mind we really want make remote controls with small televisions inside and it is not like it would not work
[1170.00-1187.70] MTD009PM: so just try to remember these points selling price twenty five of an age fifty million but more important is the in international market we are trying to focus on and production cost maximum twelve and a half euros
[1171.96-1172.96] MTD012ME: here you go message
[1180.06-1184.14] MTD012ME: so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
[1188.62-1189.90] MTD012ME: yeah right
[1189.48-1199.96] MTD009PM: so this leads us to our little discussion we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion so i am going to
[1192.74-1192.98] MTD012ME: no
[1200.00-1211.18] MTD009PM: it down i think it is easier i have got a message five minutes ok that is a good time
[1206.12-1206.68] MTD012ME: it is off now
[1207.78-1208.44] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1207.80-1208.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[1210.52-1211.56] MTD012ME: well it was on
[1215.20-1219.52] MTD009PM: maybe you have to say the magic word
[1217.08-1217.78] MTD012ME: ok there we are
[1221.08-1222.08] MTD009PM: does it do anything
[1223.42-1225.52] MTD009PM: maybe you have to just clap it down and
[1225.04-1226.42] MTD011UID: true yeah i have
[1228.28-1229.14] MTD009PM: back up again
[1233.96-1235.96] MTD009PM: slideshow
[1234.80-1236.00] MTD011UID: ok yeah
[1237.32-1241.02] MTD009PM: it is ok
[1237.46-1238.20] MTD012ME: well we have a
[1239.10-1254.42] MTD012ME: kind of broad t v at home and a d v d player so we got like a lot of remote controls one for the t v one for the video recorder one for the d v d player and i think it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
[1243.80-1246.50] MTD009PM: oh it is those laptops
[1246.36-1247.52] MTD011UID: ok yeah
[1248.40-1260.00] MTD009PM: nice ok but some does everybody has experiences with remote controls and i mean not the ordinary remote controls but also it is
[1253.88-1253.94] MTD011UID: yeah
[1257.12-1257.64] MTD011UID: ok
[1260.00-1267.48] MTD009PM: the different ones like you can use for other you know
[1278.08-1278.52] MTD012ME: oh really
[1279.08-1279.58] MTD009PM: yeah
[1284.68-1289.92] MTD009PM: yeah yeah i have i have got one at home and you can program i
[1286.76-1287.00] MTD012ME: yeah
[1290.00-1318.92] MTD009PM: think eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television and anything else and it also operates on infrared so you have got a little device inside your room and then you can operate it from the third or th second floor so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d v d player downstairs and you have got it linked to your t v on the second floor so that is a pretty handy
[1304.20-1304.44] MTD012ME: yeah
[1307.76-1309.68] MTD012ME: so i think you can take minutes together
[1311.44-1311.80] MTD011UID: so
[1311.56-1312.40] MTD012ME: six a two a two
[1316.04-1316.70] MTD011UID: sure
[1316.08-1316.32] MTD012ME: yeah
[1319.76-1320.00] MTD011UID: so
[1320.00-1320.84] MTD011UID: proof or
[1320.20-1320.52] MTD009PM: thing
[1321.84-1324.60] MTD009PM: but only the
[1322.20-1324.92] MTD011UID: yeah you never know i i would i mean
[1325.68-1334.78] MTD009PM: i think the if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control that makes it a lot easier as well that is nice
[1330.48-1334.78] MTD012ME: yeah but that would be really good if we could do that
[1336.46-1337.56] MTD009PM: it is good to remember
[1339.88-1344.82] MTD009PM: yeah that is nice i think so we we want different functions
[1341.32-1341.52] MTD011UID: kay
[1344.24-1345.36] MTD012ME: think it has to be shock proof
[1346.60-1346.88] MTD012ME: yes
[1346.76-1349.98] MTD009PM: and we can
[1348.40-1350.00] MTD012ME: my remote control tends to
[1350.00-1360.22] MTD009PM: maybe see if we can do something with infrared but i do not know if that will exceed the production costs so that is something we have to find out i think
[1350.00-1350.44] MTD012ME: proof
[1350.36-1351.24] MTD011UID: ok
[1351.86-1352.16] MTD012ME: so
[1365.92-1368.92] MTD009PM: other functions for a remote control
[1370.40-1372.48] MTD0010ID: well they were all mentioned so
[1370.40-1373.28] MTD009PM: maybe we can make it
[1371.48-1377.64] MTD012ME: yeah one other little thing i thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
[1377.24-1378.08] MTD009PM: sharp proof
[1378.76-1379.40] MTD012ME: so i can see
[1380.84-1382.12] MTD012ME: how much is left in the battery
[1382.44-1382.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[1384.32-1389.94] MTD012ME: but they will also really drag up the production costs so people have to see about that too
[1386.88-1387.62] MTD009PM: what a group
[1389.76-1400.30] MTD009PM: ok so these are a few things we can think of i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
[1392.16-1394.36] MTD012ME: but maybe just a little nap i do not know
[1408.76-1410.00] MTD009PM: so we can see address
[1410.00-1410.40] MTD009PM: status
[1410.84-1411.80] MTD012ME: i do not think so
[1414.04-1414.30] MTD0010ID: fine
[1414.20-1415.56] MTD011UID: ok
[1418.64-1418.94] MTD009PM: yeah
[1421.56-1421.74] MTD009PM: yeah
[1423.74-1424.08] MTD012ME: ok
[1425.28-1425.82] MTD012ME: we can all
[1425.62-1427.92] MTD009PM: that is an idea as well other ideas
[1429.28-1429.88] MTD009PM: quick ideas
[1432.44-1437.92] MTD009PM: ok any questions about this presentation click off presentation
[1442.02-1442.50] MTD012ME: ok
[1442.44-1442.60] MTD009PM: so
[1443.76-1447.90] MTD009PM: ok then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
[1444.28-1445.26] MTD012ME: ok
[1449.34-1450.48] MTD009PM: and then we can all work
[1451.72-1459.56] MTD009PM: finish meeting now ok and we can all work on our own projects
[1468.18-1469.98] MTD009PM: ok then i will meet you
[1470.00-1476.40] MTD009PM: in about an hour i think well good luck

============================================================
SESSION: TS3003b
============================================================

[  57.12-  60.00] MTD009PM: ok everybody found his place again
[  60.00-  70.96] MTD009PM: yeah that is nice ok so this is our second meeting and still failing
[  60.56-  60.96] MTD012ME: yeah
[  71.80-  72.12] MTD012ME: yeah
[  72.76-  90.00] MTD009PM: and now we are going into the functional design important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements technical function
[  90.00-  92.44] MTD009PM: design and the working design
[  93.12- 107.74] MTD009PM: so that we can move on to the second phase but first this phase first announcement there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system so
[ 109.64- 119.92] MTD009PM: where is our ghost mouse again but that means that you can have a little trouble a little trouble with the air conditioning that is because of this
[ 120.38- 120.72] MTD011UID: ok
[ 121.12- 121.48] MTD012ME: ok
[ 121.56- 139.10] MTD009PM: it is in wing c and e so it should be open in a couple of days it is going to be cold anyway so i do not think you can do it then our agenda yeah first the opening this time i will take the minutes
[ 132.84- 133.18] MTD012ME: no
[ 140.36- 150.00] MTD009PM: you are going to have a presentation all of you and we have got forty minutes for the whole present
[ 150.00- 163.56] MTD009PM: if we want presentations so i i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me
[ 164.40- 179.98] MTD009PM: and then the decision on the control functions which we want to include those which we both want to include so we have got forty minutes for all of it so i suggest let us start with the first presentation
[ 180.00- 181.34] MTD009PM: who wants to do first
[ 182.76- 183.56] MTD012ME: think i will go first
[ 183.74- 186.08] MTD009PM: ok so
[ 187.94- 197.88] MTD009PM: just maybe it is easy if you yeah i think you will tell in your presentation as well just which function you have and what you are going to talk about
[ 206.60- 210.00] MTD012ME: kay my name is frank zampone i am your marketing expert
[ 210.00- 210.90] MTD012ME: we already knew that
[ 212.10- 228.20] MTD012ME: i have done some research we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls we let them fill out a questionnaire we had one hundred of these test subjects
[ 229.36- 236.64] MTD012ME: in addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
[ 238.90- 239.72] MTD012ME: well these are
[ 240.00- 249.64] MTD012ME: three quite astonishing results i thought remotes are being considered ugly f seventy five percent of the
[ 250.96- 263.20] MTD012ME: people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly and an additional eighty percent indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control so
[ 270.00- 273.32] MTD012ME: you use about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
[ 275.08- 279.40] MTD012ME: and fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room
[ 280.48- 280.80] MTD012ME: so
[ 282.32- 283.08] MTD012ME: somethings
[ 285.32- 299.96] MTD012ME: then we did some research to do the most relevant functions channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power button got a nine and teletext got a
[ 300.00- 302.24] MTD012ME: six and a half so these are the most
[ 303.36- 320.72] MTD012ME: most important functions of a remote control and then there are some one time use function that is what i like to call them they are the audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
[ 322.12- 329.44] MTD012ME: channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
[ 332.16- 341.14] MTD012ME: and these are the this is the market sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six
[ 344.12- 356.72] MTD012ME: the main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control they like to use new f new functions but they also are very critical they will not spend their money very easily so
[ 360.00- 364.24] MTD012ME: sixty five years considering they make up forty percent of the market
[ 365.24- 369.96] MTD012ME: they are not really very interested in features but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
[ 375.36- 378.12] MTD012ME: well i think this indicates for
[ 379.44- 384.80] MTD012ME: design i think we should make a remote for the future and this means we would
[ 386.00- 389.84] MTD012ME: have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five
[ 390.82- 399.38] MTD012ME: this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that would also be where our main profit would be getable
[ 400.48- 403.42] MTD012ME: this would mean we would have to make a fancy design
[ 404.84- 416.14] MTD012ME: the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused errors errors i
[ 417.56- 419.98] MTD012ME: this is certainly something to
[ 420.00- 436.72] MTD012ME: take into account and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn and how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design decides of course that the remote must look very nice
[ 438.06- 439.12] MTD012ME: functionality
[ 440.42- 449.98] MTD012ME: as a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons this will also be beneficial to
[ 450.00- 451.76] MTD012ME: the design of the remote
[ 453.28- 466.94] MTD012ME: i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons because they are used most and so they should be robust they should not break down easily
[ 471.64- 478.50] MTD012ME: then as m as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room it might be
[ 479.64- 480.00] MTD012ME: and i say
[ 480.00- 496.28] MTD012ME: it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot but it might be a good idea to make a docking station and this would could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep
[ 496.56- 503.92] MTD012ME: so you know where it is in the room and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
[ 505.72- 510.00] MTD012ME: then a surprisingly great deal of people
[ 510.00- 518.26] MTD012ME: would indicated that an l c d screen in the remote control would be preferred this was
[ 519.58- 535.74] MTD012ME: mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five but up till forty five it remains feasible this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider
[ 538.04- 538.36] MTD009PM: ok
[ 538.60- 539.24] MTD012ME: that would be all
[ 540.04- 545.16] MTD009PM: thank you so anybody have any questions until now
[ 544.20- 544.90] MTD012ME: it is a question of
[ 546.16- 546.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 546.24- 549.08] MTD009PM: about functional requirements ok that is clear
[ 550.32- 550.52] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 550.68- 551.60] MTD009PM: to the second
[ 560.28- 569.98] MTD011UID: ok i am going to look at the the usual interface of it f for the techno
[ 567.52- 567.66] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 570.00- 572.20] MTD011UID: functions of of it
[ 574.62- 578.48] MTD009PM: yeah you can take your time we got plenty of time to do it
[ 575.00- 575.44] MTD011UID: ok
[ 576.96- 577.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 577.42- 581.88] MTD012ME: yeah you should get the top thingy slideshow
[ 578.48- 578.86] MTD011UID: oh
[ 580.10- 580.52] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 581.58- 583.36] MTD009PM: yep great
[ 581.68- 581.92] MTD011UID: ok
[ 584.44- 599.96] MTD011UID: yeah i think we must use the general functions of the remote control i have done i have done a little research on the internet
[ 600.00- 609.34] MTD011UID: we have not much information about it so about interface but
[ 611.58- 629.44] MTD011UID: yeah i have been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one remote control so you have got a lot of d v devices like d v d television stereo so
[ 630.00- 646.40] MTD011UID: but it must be user friendly so you c you can put a lot of functions in one yeah in one remote control but
[ 645.36- 646.36] MTD009PM: oh that is both
[ 648.56- 648.94] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 651.30- 659.98] MTD011UID: yeah got many functions in one remote control but
[ 660.00- 674.82] MTD011UID: you can see this is quite simple remote control few buttons but this rem remote control got a lot of buttons yeah people do not like it so
[ 676.08- 690.00] MTD011UID: what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like a yards like the on off button keep it yeah like a red button
[ 690.00- 696.88] MTD011UID: everybody everybody knows it so you do not have to change that
[ 699.04- 707.88] MTD011UID: my personal preferences use display for specific functions of the different device so
[ 708.94- 714.68] MTD011UID: what i was thinking about was you got
[ 725.52- 741.44] MTD011UID: this is the remote control you got here the general functions like the on off button sound i do not know and here you got a s kind of display
[ 742.76- 749.96] MTD011UID: this is a touch screen so yeah you got the general function of the functions of the device for your d v d
[ 750.00- 764.52] MTD011UID: deplayed or so play yeah for playing reverse data we have got here real buttons for selecting a device
[ 765.84- 780.00] MTD011UID: so this buttons for d v or yeah so for every device you got a f a part a part display of a part button
[ 780.00- 793.20] MTD011UID: buttons so you you never got all the buttons on one one device so that is my idea about it yeah and
[ 790.16- 790.44] MTD009PM: ok
[ 794.56- 809.96] MTD011UID: let us see yeah so touch screen and the the buttons the real buttons we have to use we better ca use quite large buttons for yeah
[ 810.00- 812.62] MTD011UID: everybody have to use it so
[ 813.04- 825.48] MTD011UID: all eave of all people young people so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large so
[ 823.56- 823.86] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 826.98- 828.96] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 830.42- 832.68] MTD011UID: that was my part of it
[ 831.72- 836.10] MTD009PM: ok anybody has questions about the technical functions
[ 836.32- 840.00] MTD0010ID: well i think if we are going to use a touch screen we are going to go
[ 840.00- 842.32] MTD0010ID: w way above the twelve and a half euros
[ 842.52- 856.50] MTD011UID: no i i do not think so you got quite cheap touch screens it is not in the corner or something it is just one corner yeah
[ 842.60- 842.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 847.04- 847.52] MTD009PM: touch screen
[ 857.68- 869.60] MTD011UID: i have seen something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago you got yeah quite and
[ 871.44- 876.84] MTD011UID: kind of touch screen it is for
[ 878.16- 885.16] MTD011UID: twenty euros or less so it is possible
[ 882.60- 883.16] MTD009PM: right
[ 884.94- 887.02] MTD009PM: ok that is nice yeah
[ 886.28- 888.36] MTD012ME: well we will certainly make a fancy design
[ 888.56- 888.78] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 889.60- 890.00] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 889.68- 895.32] MTD0010ID: but so the it would not be very robust it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it
[ 889.88- 890.48] MTD012ME: so the
[ 895.44- 896.06] MTD012ME: that is true
[ 896.04- 900.00] MTD009PM: oh it is alright yeah maybe you can first listen to it
[ 896.60- 897.60] MTD011UID: yeah that is true
[ 897.08- 898.20] MTD012ME: we will have to look into that
[ 900.00- 906.68] MTD009PM: to your presentation and then we will have a little discussion about the requirements and the design
[ 901.60- 902.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 901.68- 902.16] MTD0010ID: yeah ok
[ 901.68- 901.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 904.92- 905.32] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 920.02- 923.84] MTD009PM: i think it is young do not it is not young yeah
[ 923.72- 929.98] MTD0010ID: ok i have got a presentation about the working design first about how it works
[ 930.00- 943.00] MTD0010ID: it is really simple of course everybody knows how a remote works the user presses a button the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the t v the t v switches to the frequency or what function it is
[ 944.20- 959.82] MTD0010ID: so we have got the plate it has got conductive disks for every button when the user presses a button a signal got sent goes to the lab and transmitted transmit transmits it to the t v
[ 960.08- 978.52] MTD0010ID: it is a very simple device technically so this is a schematic overview you have got the buttons the power source and when a button gets pressed it is goes to the chip the chip controls the infrared bulb and
[ 978.56- 983.24] MTD0010ID: perf perhaps a normal bulb when you press a button you can actually see you have pressed a button
[ 985.56- 989.88] MTD0010ID: well i think we should use default materials simple
[ 990.00-1003.00] MTD0010ID: plastics keep the inner workings simple so it is robust i think we should focus on esthetics the design and the user interface because if you are going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
[1004.88-1011.04] MTD0010ID: and you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product
[1012.08-1019.96] MTD0010ID: so it is in my idea it is it is going to be smart to invest in dis in design and not in in the product
[1020.00-1020.46] MTD0010ID: so
[1021.92-1022.50] MTD0010ID: that is it
[1023.16-1024.00] MTD009PM: ok thank you
[1031.08-1031.56] MTD009PM: kay
[1041.76-1049.98] MTD009PM: ok now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now
[1050.00-1057.24] MTD009PM: i am the project manager so i am here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements
[1058.24-1078.28] MTD009PM: that is we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t v that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions
[1068.80-1069.16] MTD011UID: ok
[1078.80-1080.00] MTD009PM: so it has to be simple
[1080.00-1100.68] MTD009PM: another point is we have to skip the teletext because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past and it is a function we do not need in our remote control
[1101.84-1109.96] MTD009PM: internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use maybe also on televisions it will be available
[1110.00-1110.64] MTD009PM: so
[1111.84-1125.78] MTD009PM: another one is the customer is forty plus that is the the market we have to to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
[1126.64-1139.98] MTD009PM: and this is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the the younger persons so we have to find a market which is above forty plus
[1140.00-1142.00] MTD009PM: but which will suit our
[1143.04-1167.20] MTD009PM: remote control and the other way around and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product so it has to be visible in our design and the way our device works and we have to be very clear on this point as well so i suggest
[1168.76-1169.96] MTD009PM: let us have
[1170.00-1172.16] MTD009PM: discussion on the control functions
[1173.66-1174.00] MTD009PM: yeah
[1174.94-1177.96] MTD012ME: so is there any discussion possible about any project requirements
[1178.96-1189.88] MTD009PM: we can we will see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product
[1189.32-1200.00] MTD012ME: yeah cause you are you are saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it is not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon and new t v s will
[1200.00-1208.64] MTD012ME: have internet access on them but i think if you are targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a t v with internet access
[1209.76-1212.78] MTD012ME: within the next like twenty years is very slim
[1214.12-1225.44] MTD012ME: in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control so i think it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it
[1227.38-1228.40] MTD012ME: i am pretty much against it
[1229.56-1230.00] MTD009PM: against the
[1230.00-1230.90] MTD009PM: note the text
[1230.96-1232.68] MTD012ME: yes
[1235.34-1238.78] MTD012ME: besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
[1239.84-1240.64] MTD012ME: pretty small
[1243.20-1248.72] MTD012ME: but i mean if i if i see this it is i think we are just going to go for another
[1244.20-1245.28] MTD009PM: yeah it is it is
[1245.20-1245.62] MTD011UID: see this
[1249.60-1251.08] MTD009PM: stand remote
[1250.44-1250.84] MTD012ME: pretty
[1252.40-1253.84] MTD009PM: no i think we can
[1252.92-1254.40] MTD012ME: in not innovative
[1255.52-1259.96] MTD009PM: i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple
[1255.64-1256.38] MTD012ME: reloc control
[1260.00-1275.76] MTD009PM: buttons which are also mentioned if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons or just a remote which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is forty percent of the market
[1273.56-1274.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[1276.60-1289.90] MTD009PM: and if you look in holland the whole generation of forty plus fifty plus it it is the the biggest share of the of the whole population now
[1291.04-1292.98] MTD012ME: yes but it is not the biggest part of the
[1294.20-1294.56] MTD012ME: market
[1295.50-1295.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[1295.58-1299.68] MTD012ME: and besides that they are not very critical so i mean they do not really care
[1300.70-1306.88] MTD012ME: what the remote control is like they will just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
[1308.72-1320.00] MTD009PM: but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market that people think from the people think that is the
[1320.00-1326.04] MTD009PM: the the device i have looked for although i did not realize it so let us try it
[1326.96-1327.20] MTD012ME: no
[1328.24-1329.60] MTD012ME: i think that would be the case and
[1331.00-1334.12] MTD012ME: sixteen to forty five age category
[1336.26-1340.76] MTD012ME: because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control
[1340.72-1340.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[1341.96-1346.04] MTD012ME: people of forty plus i mean they want it to work but
[1347.52-1349.76] MTD012ME: as so as soon as it works it is ok with them
[1351.68-1352.06] MTD009PM: yeah
[1352.76-1362.80] MTD0010ID: think that if we are if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i do not know if you have heard about it in the news the the elderly mobile phone
[1353.20-1353.56] MTD012ME: sorry
[1363.00-1364.48] MTD009PM: yeah it is a big success
[1364.68-1379.40] MTD0010ID: yeah if we if we make a remote control just li with that idea in mind we could make tons of money i think we do not have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality we just s
[1365.08-1366.10] MTD012ME: oh right
[1365.52-1367.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[1371.92-1372.16] MTD012ME: yeah
[1371.96-1373.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[1380.68-1383.46] MTD0010ID: change our focus on the project and i think
[1385.02-1386.36] MTD0010ID: we can we can sell this
[1387.22-1390.10] MTD009PM: yeah i simply think
[1393.12-1407.26] MTD009PM: that the new products we are going to make spes specifically designed are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people
[1408.60-1409.96] MTD009PM: and
[1410.00-1430.36] MTD009PM: i think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls cause what you told is the channel selection is important volume selection power and teletext ok
[1423.96-1424.26] MTD012ME: yes
[1427.46-1427.88] MTD012ME: yes
[1430.36-1432.76] MTD012ME: but obviously the board tends to disagree
[1433.24-1440.00] MTD009PM: no we we have not voted yet so i think teletext can be
[1440.00-1440.56] MTD009PM: can
[1441.96-1447.76] MTD009PM: can be a function as well but only if if it will not
[1448.72-1457.04] MTD009PM: higher the the cost because i do not know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well but i do not think it will be a problem
[1458.56-1460.02] MTD009PM: or is teletext
[1459.04-1459.72] MTD011UID: dial text
[1459.72-1465.06] MTD011UID: dev people need teletext for a subtitle so it is yeah
[1463.24-1463.52] MTD009PM: yeah
[1463.52-1464.44] MTD012ME: yeah also
[1465.48-1467.40] MTD009PM: yeah so i suggest
[1466.64-1469.72] MTD012ME: i think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext
[1467.48-1467.84] MTD011UID: but
[1469.04-1469.34] MTD011UID: yeah
[1469.08-1469.44] MTD009PM: yeah
[1470.56-1473.74] MTD009PM: is anybody really against teletext
[1474.40-1474.64] MTD0010ID: no
[1475.00-1479.56] MTD009PM: just that that you just keep the teletext
[1481.68-1484.76] MTD009PM: i think that is a good idea as well especially for the subtitles
[1486.80-1487.86] MTD009PM: maybe we can
[1489.48-1491.24] MTD009PM: make that
[1493.46-1498.92] MTD009PM: another point of advantage in our remote control if we make a c a button
[1500.00-1511.72] MTD009PM: buttons for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think oh i want to have subtitles and they push the button and they get the big subtitles
[1505.84-1506.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[1512.20-1513.30] MTD0010ID: that is a good idea
[1512.44-1513.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[1514.00-1521.64] MTD009PM: so i think the edtics can f can be very useful in our advantage
[1523.24-1526.16] MTD009PM: functionality should be few buttons you said
[1527.62-1528.00] MTD012ME: yes
[1528.28-1529.98] MTD009PM: i think
[1530.00-1532.40] MTD009PM: that is very important we have a few buttons
[1535.32-1537.00] MTD009PM: so to keep it simple
[1535.96-1536.24] MTD012ME: but
[1537.96-1540.20] MTD012ME: i do not think that is really an issue anymore cause
[1541.64-1542.64] MTD012ME: well it might be
[1543.92-1546.16] MTD011UID: if it is only for if it is only for t v yeah
[1544.16-1553.28] MTD012ME: i do not mean it for if it is only for t v you are not going to need a lot of buttons anyway you need a one to zero button next channel previous channel
[1547.14-1547.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[1548.68-1549.12] MTD009PM: need a
[1551.76-1552.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[1554.40-1557.96] MTD012ME: volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
[1559.52-1559.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[1562.00-1562.68] MTD009PM: but do you need
[1562.12-1563.60] MTD012ME: i think sh she only
[1562.50-1567.12] MTD011UID: yeah we can we can skip the display so we do not need it
[1566.54-1573.32] MTD009PM: do you do you need the buttons for one to zero maybe you could
[1567.40-1568.10] MTD012ME: nah
[1572.48-1573.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[1572.56-1585.06] MTD012ME: think you are going to include teletext you do i think many people like to use that cause you you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you do not want to push the next channel button thirty five times
[1577.12-1579.04] MTD009PM: maybe you can use
[1577.62-1577.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[1584.22-1584.40] MTD011UID: yeah
[1584.92-1587.96] MTD009PM: yeah maybe we can implement the scroll button
[1589.84-1590.00] MTD009PM: or
[1590.00-1591.52] MTD009PM: or a joystick like
[1593.04-1601.48] MTD009PM: there are other ways to just look if you look at telephones the sony telephone has a scroll button which was very useful in searching names or
[1595.72-1596.12] MTD011UID: yes
[1600.08-1600.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[1603.26-1605.24] MTD012ME: that is true but
[1607.00-1612.40] MTD012ME: i do not think there are many t v s that can switch channels that fast and so you would need like
[1613.64-1619.00] MTD012ME: a t v would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
[1620.26-1622.20] MTD012ME: and i do not know if many channels w
[1624.20-1626.12] MTD012ME: do have many t v s out there
[1626.06-1638.60] MTD0010ID: yeah and besides that it is if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt they are not used to using scroll buttons so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout
[1635.36-1635.90] MTD009PM: that is right
[1640.74-1650.00] MTD009PM: the numbers there yeah we can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display and if it is too much we can reconsider it
[1650.00-1654.92] MTD009PM: but i think they are going to be for image buttons or they are not used to be
[1651.32-1651.64] MTD011UID: oh
[1654.00-1660.64] MTD012ME: but i do not think i think if you are going to make a remote control only to operate a t v you there is not much you can gain on
[1661.68-1675.40] MTD012ME: having as few buttons as possible cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t v which already only have the minimum number of buttons i do not think there is much to be gained in that area
[1676.20-1680.00] MTD009PM: the number of buttons i think it is very important in the
[1676.20-1676.80] MTD011UID: the number of
[1677.80-1678.04] MTD012ME: yeah
[1680.00-1680.82] MTD009PM: in the design
[1681.92-1690.18] MTD009PM: you can make a very fancy design by putting the buttons in the right places if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
[1691.60-1700.00] MTD012ME: that is true but i think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t v
[1701.64-1703.38] MTD009PM: to operate on your t v
[1702.16-1708.96] MTD012ME: cause if you have a remote control only to operate a t v there is simply not a lot of buttons required
[1710.04-1715.52] MTD012ME: there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either
[1715.80-1716.12] MTD009PM: no
[1717.28-1717.92] MTD009PM: so
[1717.66-1721.84] MTD012ME: so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
[1722.52-1723.76] MTD009PM: kay so we can
[1723.04-1726.02] MTD012ME: that would that would cost a little bit a big marketing
[1728.16-1728.82] MTD012ME: expedition
[1728.18-1728.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[1729.82-1730.30] MTD009PM: that is right
[1730.40-1731.00] MTD012ME: which was
[1731.96-1736.64] MTD012ME: one of the arguments to make it only for the t v because we did not have the time to market a lot
[1737.00-1739.98] MTD009PM: yeah so you suggest we could better
[1740.00-1744.34] MTD009PM: focus on for example the docking station
[1745.72-1747.16] MTD009PM: like other functions
[1749.60-1752.10] MTD009PM: instead of a few of less buttons
[1749.74-1750.36] MTD012ME: maybe if
[1752.78-1753.08] MTD012ME: well
[1754.12-1758.36] MTD012ME: yeah i think i mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
[1759.40-1761.52] MTD012ME: but i do not think we should spend very much time in that
[1762.38-1766.72] MTD009PM: no you think the docking station will
[1767.88-1769.98] MTD009PM: i is allowed in the
[1770.00-1771.14] MTD009PM: budget we have
[1772.60-1779.14] MTD0010ID: it should be possible yes if it is not too fancy and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible yeah
[1774.04-1774.92] MTD009PM: got it
[1774.36-1775.08] MTD011UID: no
[1776.20-1776.60] MTD009PM: no
[1779.00-1781.50] MTD009PM: yeah cause i think that is
[1779.40-1779.56] MTD011UID: no
[1782.56-1793.64] MTD009PM: that is a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking documentation or very sort of that is a nice requirement
[1785.68-1786.12] MTD0010ID: yes
[1794.84-1795.80] MTD009PM: documentation
[1797.00-1799.02] MTD0010ID: so we are just going to focus on the extras
[1800.46-1801.12] MTD009PM: i think so
[1801.82-1802.00] MTD011UID: no
[1801.92-1804.28] MTD012ME: yeah i think maybe we should do some research on to
[1805.32-1807.32] MTD012ME: what elderly people like to have in a
[1808.24-1808.64] MTD009PM: yeah
[1808.50-1810.40] MTD012ME: like to have extra in in remote control
[1811.16-1813.84] MTD009PM: that is a good point
[1816.40-1818.68] MTD009PM: you said they easily get lost as well
[1820.00-1824.44] MTD012ME: yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost
[1822.90-1823.22] MTD009PM: yeah
[1824.56-1829.40] MTD009PM: so maybe we should implement the audio side or something
[1829.64-1830.00] MTD012ME: yeah the
[1830.00-1844.04] MTD012ME: as well i suggested you have it on yeah you have it on some some phones too which have a docking station and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing so you know where it is
[1831.04-1831.44] MTD009PM: yeah
[1831.58-1835.48] MTD0010ID: like with your keychain if you play solid guns it makes a sound
[1832.88-1833.48] MTD009PM: yeah
[1839.10-1839.36] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1842.68-1852.80] MTD009PM: yeah audio signal should be possible as well i think it is not too expensive just another
[1854.28-1856.92] MTD009PM: or the l c d screen
[1859.20-1860.00] MTD009PM: yeah
[1860.00-1865.76] MTD009PM: i do not know if that will rise the cost too much
[1865.24-1869.74] MTD0010ID: yeah i think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen cause
[1870.84-1872.90] MTD009PM: yeah it is going to be too much as well
[1871.20-1871.80] MTD0010ID: s
[1873.16-1890.00] MTD012ME: i think since a lot of people indicate that a new remote control is hard to learn and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it which would tell
[1890.00-1890.68] MTD012ME: you what it does
[1892.20-1892.48] MTD009PM: yeah
[1893.12-1897.30] MTD012ME: and it would not have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen but
[1895.68-1896.12] MTD009PM: very
[1895.96-1897.56] MTD011UID: expensive yeah
[1898.96-1901.70] MTD009PM: just the l c d just a normal screen
[1902.38-1904.38] MTD012ME: just a small screen maybe two
[1903.16-1907.42] MTD009PM: small screen maybe some extra info feedback
[1906.96-1907.36] MTD012ME: yeah
[1908.98-1910.60] MTD009PM: yeah i think that is a good idea as well
[1909.00-1909.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[1911.52-1913.08] MTD012ME: but i do not know if that would
[1914.64-1915.84] MTD009PM: it is the small screen
[1915.20-1916.36] MTD012ME: that would split into the
[1919.72-1920.00] MTD012ME: costs
[1920.00-1920.28] MTD012ME: so
[1924.26-1925.80] MTD009PM: expert button info
[1929.40-1949.98] MTD009PM: i think that should be possible as well let us see what did we say more should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn few buttons we talked about that talking station l c d general function
[1950.00-1950.72] MTD009PM: shoes
[1952.50-1953.16] MTD009PM: yeah
[1956.04-1956.48] MTD009PM: ok
[1960.36-1962.80] MTD009PM: and default materials
[1964.52-1979.44] MTD009PM: i think that is a good idea as well because other people do not mind if it is titanium cover or just the plastic one so it does not really matter so i think
[1975.20-1975.80] MTD012ME: no
[1979.00-1980.00] MTD012ME: i think probably
[1980.00-1984.36] MTD012ME: elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and
[1985.54-1986.08] MTD012ME: youngsters
[1988.78-2006.86] MTD009PM: let us specify the target group are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty because i think what we are going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
[2009.36-2009.54] MTD012ME: yeah
[2010.44-2019.24] MTD009PM: what do we want if we want profilators with for example the the telephone for elderly people we can
[2011.08-2011.56] MTD012ME: i think
[2020.52-2022.52] MTD009PM: target a real elderly people
[2024.28-2031.98] MTD012ME: i think there would be if we should do something like that it would be i think it would be really good for for the image of the company
[2033.24-2033.52] MTD009PM: yeah
[2033.80-2036.80] MTD012ME: and i think i think there would be good market for it
[2038.00-2038.94] MTD009PM: so that is the w
[2038.52-2039.98] MTD012ME: if we are able to
[2040.00-2042.10] MTD012ME: it is really bring an innovative product
[2042.48-2045.36] MTD009PM: and you are talking about sixty two eighty for example
[2045.10-2046.28] MTD012ME: yeah the really
[2046.82-2049.38] MTD009PM: yeah sixty
[2048.30-2048.56] MTD012ME: but
[2050.40-2051.96] MTD012ME: i have to look into that a little more
[2052.34-2056.92] MTD009PM: ok and different cultures probably
[2057.40-2060.92] MTD0010ID: oh i do not think they have different television sets
[2062.00-2062.52] MTD011UID: ok
[2062.20-2062.74] MTD009PM: ok
[2062.34-2063.44] MTD0010ID: in in every country
[2064.20-2064.64] MTD009PM: no
[2065.48-2065.80] MTD0010ID: oh
[2067.60-2069.98] MTD009PM: we have got five minutes left to make some sense
[2069.68-2070.00] MTD012ME: ok
[2070.00-2070.96] MTD009PM: so
[2070.00-2077.96] MTD012ME: so and with the the little screen in it with the which explains the buttons you could i think we it would be a lot easier to
[2078.96-2081.12] MTD012ME: adapt it to different cultures
[2081.68-2083.96] MTD009PM: yeah in different languages you can have it yeah
[2083.18-2083.48] MTD012ME: yeah
[2083.36-2083.66] MTD0010ID: yeah
[2085.22-2099.98] MTD009PM: or you have to put a language button in it that will be a bit unnecessary it is better to put it on different markets with you know ok so that is the target and then
[2089.04-2090.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[2090.24-2090.56] MTD012ME: yeah
[2094.56-2094.84] MTD0010ID: yeah
[2100.00-2103.24] MTD009PM: a few small things
[2105.96-2129.88] MTD009PM: ok i will put the minutes in the project project document folder what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the component concept because interface designer they use interface concept and trend watching so just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group i do not
[2130.00-2139.56] MTD009PM: requirements the trends which are going on and specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach
[2140.48-2140.62] MTD012ME: ok
[2140.84-2146.56] MTD009PM: so i thank you for this meeting and i think we have a lunch break now
[2147.12-2147.76] MTD012ME: that is good
[2147.96-2149.38] MTD009PM: so that is a good thing

============================================================
SESSION: TS3003c
============================================================

[  21.28-  30.00] MTD009PM: ok bye good afternoon is your third meeting already i hope you enjoyed your lunch
[  24.08-  24.64] MTD012ME: yeah
[  30.00-  36.02] MTD009PM: and if you like
[  39.60-  60.00] MTD009PM: resultation three ok this is the second phase we are going to discuss today at the conceptual design meeting and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specifications
[  60.00-  60.96] MTD009PM: of components
[  61.24-  75.80] MTD009PM: conceptual specification of design and also trend watching these are hopefully the points you addressed in your cra presentation you are going to show me in a few minutes
[  77.08-  89.96] MTD009PM: at first i will show you the agenda first the opening then we have three presentations after that we have to come to a decision on the remote control
[  90.00-  98.00] MTD009PM: for concepts are we going to make it and then we are closing we have about forty minutes
[  99.14- 107.46] MTD009PM: so i suggest let us get started did someone encounter any problems during the operation
[ 109.64- 112.56] MTD009PM: no everything fine it says
[ 109.76- 109.96] MTD011UID: no
[ 114.80- 117.00] MTD009PM: then a little
[ 117.60- 120.00] MTD009PM: thing about
[ 120.00- 139.88] MTD009PM: the last meeting these are the points we create on the requirements and the target market requirements are teletext docking station audio signal small screen that is an extra tel button information and we are going to use default materials
[ 141.38- 149.96] MTD009PM: does somebody have any comments on these requirements maybe no these are just
[ 150.00- 157.56] MTD009PM: things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know maybe you can work it out
[ 158.44- 163.36] MTD009PM: and we are going to target the sixty to to eighty year old customers
[ 165.12- 174.02] MTD009PM: so now everybody knows what we are do what we are doing i suggest let us get started with the presentations
[ 175.32- 180.00] MTD009PM: so you keep the same line up as last time
[ 180.28- 183.00] MTD012ME: here i will start off that way
[ 180.88- 181.24] MTD009PM: ok
[ 182.68- 184.52] MTD009PM: ok
[ 192.72- 193.36] MTD012ME: do not
[ 203.96- 209.98] MTD012ME: kay i am going to inform you about the trend watching out of the buttons over the past few days
[ 210.00- 216.10] MTD012ME: we have done some market research we distributed some more on cats questionnaires
[ 216.70- 235.24] MTD012ME: and besides that i deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends and i have consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
[ 236.84- 239.98] MTD012ME: the best design would be
[ 240.00- 267.76] MTD012ME: ok these are some overall findings most important thing is the fancy design the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls
[ 269.00- 270.00] MTD012ME: about
[ 270.00- 291.92] MTD012ME: half of half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use for our group we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty years old this is these factors are slightly more equal
[ 295.08- 300.00] MTD012ME: ok these are some more group specific findings the older people prefer dark colors
[ 300.00- 310.92] MTD012ME: colors they like recognizable shapes and familiar material and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
[ 312.00- 327.64] MTD012ME: the material for older people this is this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that a remote should have
[ 331.08- 339.32] MTD012ME: this leads us to some personal preferences the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the
[ 340.44- 359.98] MTD012ME: in the room so this would mean no eye catching designs just keep it simple and well the docking station and the small screen would be our main points of interest because this would be the these would be the
[ 360.00- 362.72] MTD012ME: innovativeness in the remote control
[ 363.94- 384.70] MTD012ME: so this would be very important that we at least include these features well the trend watchers i consulted advised that it should be the remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped so you could imagine that the remote control would be standing up straight in the docking station
[ 385.50- 389.96] MTD012ME: this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to
[ 390.00- 401.70] MTD012ME: older people so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station so it would be kinda more telephone shaped
[ 402.66- 419.96] MTD012ME: besides that we would advise to bring two editions one with a wood like color and maybe feel and one with a gray black color the wood like for the more exclusive people people with more money
[ 420.00- 422.28] MTD012ME: the great black color for well
[ 425.34- 427.32] MTD012ME: people with less means
[ 430.98- 432.04] MTD012ME: that would be all
[ 432.56- 437.56] MTD009PM: ok thank you any questions about the trends
[ 436.36- 437.10] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 438.36- 439.44] MTD011UID: no
[ 440.60- 443.64] MTD009PM: oh ok you are going to the next
[ 464.16- 480.00] MTD011UID: kay yeah did some research about designing of interface yeah last meeting we had about using a f few buttons so
[ 480.00- 485.32] MTD011UID: that is what i want to
[ 486.80- 509.16] MTD011UID: to do in our designs finding an attractive way to control the remote control the i found some something about speech recognition so maybe we can use that
[ 509.44- 510.00] MTD011UID: yeah and
[ 510.00- 522.56] MTD011UID: using a little display so thanks yeah just you have to just to focus on the primary functions
[ 522.56- 539.20] MTD011UID: so only buttons for sound for on off shifting up s can in a channel or down shifting down let us see yeah and
[ 541.08- 562.44] MTD011UID: yeah f we need some new and attractive functions which attract people for using it so it is like a speek speech recognition and special button for selecting subtitles just as we mentioned last meeting
[ 563.36- 569.98] MTD011UID: and yeah overall user friendly so using large large buttons
[ 574.56- 593.16] MTD011UID: it is possible to y to make quite cheap system for speech recognition you can think about when you lost your remote control you can call it and it give us an sig signal so yeah
[ 593.56- 599.98] MTD011UID: and and for shifting up a s an a c a ch channel or for
[ 600.00- 609.36] MTD011UID: putting out the sound or something you can just give a sign say sound off or
[ 610.36- 617.86] MTD011UID: and yeah television put the sound off put the sound off
[ 619.80- 629.98] MTD011UID: let us see yeah i was thinking about a special button for subtitles just one button to keep it simple one push on the button you get
[ 630.00- 631.86] MTD011UID: s small subtitles
[ 632.52- 642.04] MTD011UID: double push push double click so you get big subtitles for people
[ 643.28- 651.36] MTD011UID: which can of who can read small subtitles over
[ 653.00- 659.98] MTD011UID: yeah and we we have to keep in general buttons so we have got the buttons we have to use the
[ 660.00- 666.08] MTD011UID: one off sound on off sound higher lower and the numbers zero to nine
[ 667.24- 685.48] MTD011UID: and the general button more general one button for shifting up shifting down yeah also we want to use a little t display for for displaying the the functions of the buttons
[ 686.08- 689.98] MTD011UID: and we can build in a function f which
[ 690.00- 702.20] MTD011UID: shows the channel or from which the t television is also made a little picture of it
[ 703.62- 704.28] MTD011UID: see
[ 709.76- 719.88] MTD011UID: yeah just we can put the on off button over here in this corner almost every
[ 720.00- 734.12] MTD011UID: all remote controls are using on off button on that place so people will recognize the buttons so
[ 735.38- 746.16] MTD011UID: display of it it is just a small display it is for we can put it on top it is the most
[ 747.88- 750.00] MTD011UID: yeah place people
[ 750.00- 765.76] MTD011UID: most often looks at so yeah special button for shifting up and shifting down channel it is on place where the thumb of of the
[ 767.20- 774.04] MTD011UID: so you you can easily shift up or shift down it is quite
[ 775.60- 779.96] MTD011UID: handy place so and a lot of functions for sub
[ 780.00- 783.08] MTD011UID: it will one bit for sound
[ 784.72- 792.86] MTD011UID: yeah and the overall design yeah we have to discuss about it i think so the form of it so
[ 794.24- 794.56] MTD009PM: ok
[ 794.72- 795.72] MTD011UID: and that is it
[ 796.32- 797.88] MTD009PM: thank you
[ 807.72- 808.32] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 814.38- 836.00] MTD0010ID: about the components design for the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy but if we choose for that option the docking station could become obsolete so i do not think it is really an option
[ 836.86- 839.84] MTD0010ID: for the casing the
[ 840.00- 853.48] MTD0010ID: fiction department can deliver a flat casing single or double curved casing it is really up to the design that we are going to use it is does not imply any technical restrictions
[ 854.24- 861.52] MTD0010ID: as a case supplement we could i thought of that later a rubber belt like anti slip
[ 863.44- 869.96] MTD0010ID: for the buttons we can use plastic or rubber and the chip set it says simple here
[ 870.00- 873.24] MTD0010ID: but it should be advanced because we are using an l c d screen
[ 874.18- 889.12] MTD0010ID: and as the trend watcher presentation shows people like wood but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image unless we would start two product lines the form should follow function overall
[ 889.70- 899.98] MTD0010ID: well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy but depends on what we want i think we should discuss that
[ 900.00- 915.76] MTD0010ID: for the case the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer and the chip set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control that is it
[ 916.20- 917.84] MTD009PM: ok thank you
[ 920.08- 924.32] MTD009PM: so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts
[ 934.64- 934.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 945.08- 948.24] MTD009PM: so these are the points we have to discuss
[ 949.60- 953.18] MTD009PM: first
[ 955.52- 958.44] MTD009PM: i think we can talk about the energy source
[ 958.68- 960.00] MTD009PM: since that is the
[ 961.64- 970.10] MTD009PM: has a pretty big influence on production price and image so
[ 971.24- 979.24] MTD009PM: f i think first of all we have to see it it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget
[ 977.98- 989.96] MTD0010ID: yes there are there are four options we could use the basic normal battery a hand dynamo but i do not think that is really an option you do not want to swing before you can
[ 982.32- 982.66] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 986.24- 987.76] MTD009PM: ok
[ 990.00- 997.66] MTD0010ID: is television solar cells but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option or the kinetic energy
[ 990.66- 991.04] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 994.40- 994.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 999.40-1001.06] MTD009PM: yeah ok cool
[1000.76-1004.12] MTD012ME: and how exactly does the kinetic energy works they just
[1003.60-1007.88] MTD0010ID: well you you basically shake your remote and then it powers up yeah
[1005.16-1007.46] MTD012ME: we use it and it works
[1008.48-1008.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[1009.02-1017.08] MTD012ME: ok well personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it
[1009.08-1009.40] MTD011UID: yeah
[1017.24-1018.16] MTD0010ID: yeah that is true
[1019.24-1019.96] MTD012ME: and
[1020.00-1032.68] MTD012ME: sides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could
[1033.72-1035.60] MTD012ME: get great popularity for our product
[1037.68-1038.14] MTD009PM: yeah
[1038.00-1038.50] MTD011UID: but
[1039.72-1043.74] MTD011UID: what is the function yeah for for the loading up the batteries but
[1044.24-1049.96] MTD012ME: yeah you could load up the batteries you could insert the find the
[1045.02-1045.40] MTD011UID: but but
[1050.00-1051.96] MTD012ME: most remote control function there
[1052.80-1073.28] MTD011UID: yeah ok but i will not use much energy i b i believe it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or m or more so i believe one battery is just enough so
[1068.72-1069.10] MTD009PM: yeah
[1074.00-1080.00] MTD009PM: yeah well i think it is true elderly people just like to have everything in place
[1074.90-1077.20] MTD012ME: that is true
[1080.00-1091.56] MTD009PM: and i do not think they they like a remote just laying everywhere in their rooms so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
[1087.20-1087.64] MTD011UID: right
[1090.88-1092.04] MTD011UID: yeah that is true yeah
[1092.40-1110.00] MTD009PM: and also what you said you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote but i think it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station so you have
[1100.48-1100.68] MTD011UID: ok
[1101.72-1102.12] MTD011UID: yeah
[1110.00-1114.40] MTD009PM: a but button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping
[1114.80-1115.64] MTD011UID: ok
[1116.26-1122.14] MTD009PM: and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the channels
[1117.94-1118.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[1122.64-1123.00] MTD011UID: no
[1123.22-1123.96] MTD009PM: it is
[1123.34-1129.54] MTD012ME: i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
[1130.24-1131.98] MTD009PM: yeah that is a good point
[1131.38-1136.28] MTD0010ID: i do not have any m informational pricing so i will have to ask the manufacturing department
[1137.34-1140.00] MTD012ME: cause in our earlier
[1140.00-1145.52] MTD012ME: market research if you would allow me to put you on the flat board
[1142.64-1144.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[1150.60-1152.38] MTD012ME: so it was opened here
[1153.60-1155.94] MTD012ME: we also
[1159.14-1170.00] MTD012ME: asked if they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control well you can see here our target group would not do that so if they would increase the
[1167.88-1168.28] MTD009PM: no
[1170.00-1172.28] MTD012ME: price for which we are selling our remote control
[1173.92-1181.76] MTD012ME: i would greatly advise not to do it i think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for the
[1176.48-1176.90] MTD009PM: yeah
[1183.12-1183.30] MTD009PM: yeah
[1183.20-1183.92] MTD012ME: younger people
[1185.32-1188.12] MTD0010ID: but that would also go for the l c d screen then i guess
[1185.64-1186.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[1189.46-1191.36] MTD0010ID: it is a bit higher percentage but
[1193.12-1200.00] MTD012ME: well this is yeah but this is you are the question was would you prefer it so that does not really
[1200.00-1209.72] MTD012ME: mean they would not pay extra for it and on top of that the l c d screen would help in making the remote control easier to use
[1211.96-1212.68] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[1212.12-1217.72] MTD012ME: and i think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
[1216.96-1219.62] MTD009PM: change with use no i think that is a good point
[1220.12-1230.00] MTD011UID: but it is this re it is about a big large l c d s display or just a small one v one
[1230.00-1230.76] MTD011UID: want to use
[1230.64-1237.44] MTD012ME: well this was for like an l c d screen like you would have on a l the most advanced mobile phones
[1237.72-1238.18] MTD011UID: ok
[1238.48-1239.72] MTD012ME: so pretty large
[1240.02-1240.26] MTD011UID: yeah
[1240.36-1240.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[1243.48-1257.56] MTD009PM: i personally think the l c d screen we want to use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it cause it is just some extra information and it is easy to ignore as well but if you do not want to use it you just do not use it
[1254.68-1254.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[1258.42-1259.98] MTD009PM: and
[1260.00-1279.46] MTD009PM: yeah i think the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition because it will increase cost significantly and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use as well
[1280.08-1280.52] MTD011UID: no
[1281.22-1289.98] MTD009PM: so that brings us back to the energy if we do not have voice recognition it will it will not use a lot of energy to use
[1293.48-1304.66] MTD009PM: so in that case we could use kinetic energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good and much cheaper as well
[1304.78-1305.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[1305.86-1306.32] MTD009PM: so
[1305.90-1307.14] MTD0010ID: yeah that is the best choice
[1307.70-1314.84] MTD009PM: ok then we just choose for the battery that brings us to the chip
[1315.52-1320.00] MTD0010ID: well there is not any choice there because we are using the the the display so
[1317.48-1318.46] MTD009PM: just a little pause
[1320.00-1321.00] MTD0010ID: it has got to be advanced
[1321.28-1324.64] MTD009PM: ok that is my advanced chip
[1321.92-1322.24] MTD012ME: ok
[1330.10-1347.32] MTD009PM: and we get to the point of the case which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well if you want to choose for wood or the black and gray or both
[1349.08-1349.96] MTD009PM: and
[1350.00-1372.68] MTD009PM: as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce but i think it will attract all of the people who want to have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids look i have got a new remote control
[1355.36-1355.72] MTD012ME: juice
[1359.24-1363.04] MTD0010ID: i do not know i will have to research
[1368.88-1369.36] MTD012ME: great
[1371.40-1379.98] MTD012ME: cool and i think the most important factor there is the wooden color so it would not actually have to be wood
[1371.88-1373.60] MTD011UID: i do not know
[1380.00-1381.36] MTD012ME: yeah it was just
[1380.50-1380.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[1383.52-1384.00] MTD009PM: that is right
[1384.84-1385.58] MTD012ME: wood color
[1386.18-1389.04] MTD009PM: but wood color was a lot more expensive or
[1389.86-1390.38] MTD009PM: you do not know
[1392.12-1400.64] MTD009PM: i think so because yeah it is a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape
[1394.60-1395.60] MTD012ME: probably
[1400.80-1410.00] MTD011UID: is it possible to make an changeable case so you got yeah with mobile phones
[1410.00-1418.08] MTD011UID: so like the nokia the mobile phones when you can change the case of it so
[1413.88-1414.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[1417.84-1419.40] MTD009PM: so it is the cases yeah
[1419.30-1433.80] MTD011UID: maybe it is possible possibility so you have just to make one standard remote control and yeah you can sell a few yeah
[1423.96-1425.74] MTD012ME: yeah that is true
[1431.80-1436.70] MTD012ME: yeah we would have to look carefully into the design though
[1432.60-1440.00] MTD009PM: i am going to sell the case yeah i think that is a very good option because then you can
[1440.00-1447.68] MTD009PM: advertise as well with give your grandfather a new place for his remote control or whatever
[1440.00-1445.16] MTD012ME: make one mo control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
[1444.42-1444.74] MTD011UID: kay
[1446.46-1451.52] MTD012ME: plastic cover the more original one the more standard one
[1448.14-1461.44] MTD009PM: because that is it is something extra as it is something other remotes do not have which we can get a great advantage point so and then you can make a mood color black and gray or it colors as well
[1452.68-1452.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[1453.00-1453.44] MTD012ME: so that would
[1458.40-1458.62] MTD0010ID: yes
[1459.02-1461.64] MTD012ME: well i would not design a telephone but
[1460.62-1461.08] MTD011UID: yeah that is it
[1466.04-1466.76] MTD009PM: of course
[1466.56-1470.00] MTD012ME: well no i think we should just we should then just design one
[1470.00-1470.94] MTD012ME: one
[1470.80-1471.24] MTD0010ID: yes
[1472.36-1478.68] MTD012ME: one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
[1473.40-1486.98] MTD0010ID: well the the general like most older remotes are flat just straight and our d p manufacturing department can also do different single curved or double curved ca curved cases
[1477.96-1478.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[1480.64-1483.04] MTD012ME: so but that should not be too much of a problem
[1482.96-1487.70] MTD009PM: yeah so you suggest we should design two different telephones
[1488.92-1498.30] MTD009PM: on which you can apply a l phone remote control on which you can apply different case covers
[1490.08-1500.00] MTD0010ID: it would just only affect the form for as far as i know so it is generally just up to the design department what we are going to use
[1494.92-1499.98] MTD012ME: i heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double
[1500.00-1502.36] MTD0010ID: it does not really matter for the price or the functionality
[1500.00-1503.12] MTD012ME: curved could you explain that a little more
[1502.16-1502.58] MTD009PM: remote
[1504.12-1505.36] MTD0010ID: pick one you like yes
[1507.80-1508.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[1509.86-1510.36] MTD009PM: ok
[1514.24-1517.68] MTD009PM: so everybody is ok with the changing covers
[1517.28-1519.52] MTD012ME: and what would single curved and double curved mean
[1518.52-1520.58] MTD009PM: i think that is a good big option
[1518.56-1518.94] MTD011UID: right
[1523.88-1525.56] MTD009PM: change in case cause
[1529.92-1530.00] MTD012ME: i
[1530.00-1530.32] MTD012ME: ok
[1531.24-1531.58] MTD009PM: yeah
[1532.64-1535.40] MTD012ME: so we can pretty much just do whatever we want
[1536.64-1536.88] MTD012ME: ok
[1537.88-1538.24] MTD012ME: that is good
[1548.46-1549.68] MTD012ME: no just to lay down
[1551.24-1552.28] MTD012ME: ok
[1557.88-1558.88] MTD012ME: well besides it
[1566.62-1567.60] MTD009PM: kay
[1569.32-1573.08] MTD009PM: but the form has to be it has to
[1574.42-1579.12] MTD009PM: it is has to be possible to stand up or just only to like
[1580.20-1580.72] MTD011UID: ok
[1580.50-1584.16] MTD009PM: and the the cover of the the docking station is also
[1585.26-1587.92] MTD009PM: on top of the television then or not
[1590.00-1600.48] MTD009PM: you can ju yeah they are clicking it in that is ok so the interface what type of interface do we want to use
[1594.56-1619.00] MTD012ME: you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you could so your thumb could be easily well i think that is a very good point cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r s i so that would be great for that i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
[1601.88-1607.08] MTD009PM: maybe we can make a little drawing of it and
[1609.02-1613.80] MTD009PM: on the b the board does somebody have ideas for a forum or
[1615.36-1619.98] MTD011UID: we can just use the regular form of it but it is
[1620.00-1621.92] MTD011UID: not quite a fancy show
[1620.96-1623.54] MTD012ME: for left handed users also
[1623.28-1623.64] MTD011UID: yeah
[1631.84-1633.16] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[1646.56-1649.82] MTD012ME: for the president
[1650.68-1653.24] MTD011UID: for yeah yeah
[1651.80-1657.20] MTD012ME: yeah we could do that but i am not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
[1653.44-1653.76] MTD009PM: ok
[1655.76-1656.72] MTD011UID: yeah or
[1658.28-1679.28] MTD011UID: is possible to program it so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for for shifting o or buttons shifting up and on the o or the no the o other side buttons for shifting for for the sound or or is it
[1663.96-1675.26] MTD012ME: but if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote
[1677.12-1679.40] MTD012ME: cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff
[1679.16-1679.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[1685.52-1686.16] MTD012ME: that is true
[1686.82-1692.40] MTD009PM: fused yeah is a fused will be a lot more difficult than that
[1687.84-1688.52] MTD011UID: yeah
[1692.64-1692.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[1710.80-1711.48] MTD011UID: yeah but
[1711.52-1714.96] MTD009PM: but you have extra buttons so people can get confused
[1713.34-1713.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[1714.88-1715.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[1716.46-1716.70] MTD011UID: yeah
[1717.72-1720.86] MTD009PM: especially if they have the same writings on it
[1722.36-1727.72] MTD011UID: see yeah or you have to make left one after each other
[1726.40-1732.36] MTD009PM: can not we make can not we make a remote which you can flip over and use
[1733.40-1734.16] MTD009PM: on the same
[1735.72-1737.88] MTD009PM: functions as the normal one
[1738.56-1739.72] MTD011UID: you mean
[1740.28-1741.60] MTD009PM: then you have to
[1740.76-1741.52] MTD011UID: yeah you have
[1742.92-1743.98] MTD009PM: let us see ok
[1746.20-1747.48] MTD009PM: ok
[1750.68-1752.80] MTD009PM: there you go
[1772.70-1774.84] MTD009PM: yes l l c d screen
[1777.72-1781.08] MTD009PM: mine has to take
[1783.20-1783.52] MTD012ME: yeah
[1789.98-1790.36] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1801.94-1807.84] MTD0010ID: i think we should start by by choosing a case because that is the basis we are building on
[1804.34-1805.52] MTD009PM: is it plus and the min
[1808.00-1810.00] MTD012ME: yeah that is true
[1808.62-1814.96] MTD009PM: no it is not very handy i think because the plus and the min will be opposite in all kinds of
[1811.76-1814.44] MTD0010ID: so like a a broad amount
[1816.98-1818.14] MTD009PM: no it is not very weird
[1819.82-1830.00] MTD009PM: i guess maybe it is yeah but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand
[1820.24-1821.48] MTD0010ID: you got the flat case
[1821.32-1822.32] MTD011UID: yeah
[1822.72-1823.32] MTD0010ID: ok
[1829.74-1830.00] MTD0010ID: s
[1830.00-1839.92] MTD0010ID: from the side so it is rather normal with a single curve so i am not really sure what they are going to look like but i think it is something like this
[1830.00-1832.60] MTD009PM: i think the functions are
[1833.88-1839.60] MTD009PM: that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel or
[1839.24-1839.36] MTD012ME: yeah
[1839.72-1840.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[1841.80-1846.78] MTD011UID: just using a u thumb so
[1844.60-1849.60] MTD009PM: yeah yeah i think we can just leave it the normal shape
[1847.36-1856.32] MTD0010ID: so this type should be better for you or better should prevent better the stray injury a bit
[1849.56-1849.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[1851.92-1853.64] MTD009PM: but maybe we have to
[1855.64-1859.88] MTD009PM: make it a li a bit more fancy in one another way
[1858.56-1859.98] MTD0010ID: and a double curve
[1860.00-1862.74] MTD0010ID: s look something like this i guess
[1860.06-1860.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[1861.84-1862.10] MTD012ME: right
[1866.92-1868.32] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[1868.74-1869.14] MTD009PM: yeah
[1871.44-1873.88] MTD009PM: yeah i see
[1873.16-1876.00] MTD0010ID: so those are the three options we have
[1892.56-1892.92] MTD009PM: yep
[1912.00-1912.48] MTD009PM: yeah
[1933.16-1933.40] MTD011UID: yeah
[1936.24-1949.98] MTD009PM: kay i suggest the the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in so that elderly people can
[1950.00-1957.60] MTD009PM: use a remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen because it is a bit it has a bit of an angle
[1955.80-1956.48] MTD011UID: so
[1958.76-1960.14] MTD011UID: you say this
[1963.28-1963.92] MTD011UID: s
[1967.68-1972.68] MTD011UID: you got a curve sort of here here
[1973.98-1979.80] MTD011UID: so you want to put this way over here no yeah
[1979.10-1980.00] MTD009PM: yeah i think so
[1980.00-1980.56] MTD009PM: yeah
[1983.62-2000.92] MTD011UID: yeah can ma it is top so just like just down maybe it is possible to make this side like let us see
[1984.96-1985.68] MTD009PM: now it is
[1986.88-1991.52] MTD009PM: do you have an upside down or do you have a top that is top
[1992.48-1992.90] MTD009PM: ok
[2001.96-2004.28] MTD011UID: color
[2010.76-2014.24] MTD011UID: to make this side
[2016.52-2021.84] MTD0010ID: it is more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it is always a bone phone
[2016.68-2022.90] MTD011UID: a bit like so in the form of your hand so
[2024.44-2025.42] MTD011UID: it is an
[2025.82-2026.22] MTD009PM: yep
[2026.96-2035.36] MTD011UID: so so the remote control i have to lay in your hand so it is possible therefore so so we can
[2028.04-2030.30] MTD0010ID: maybe you should just start on a blank page
[2034.60-2036.18] MTD009PM: so we get your mouse yeah
[2037.14-2039.98] MTD011UID: and to put in the
[2040.00-2041.52] MTD011UID: the buttons for
[2042.84-2046.00] MTD011UID: changing the channel over here
[2044.28-2044.62] MTD012ME: yeah
[2046.92-2053.86] MTD009PM: yeah that is a good one but i think it is better to put the screen on top
[2051.36-2051.78] MTD012ME: yeah
[2055.64-2067.60] MTD009PM: so just flip it hundred and eighty degrees around and that is that here if you can have this one you turn it like this and then flip it upside down
[2059.12-2061.20] MTD011UID: yeah but this plate
[2060.56-2061.20] MTD012ME: yeah
[2068.36-2070.00] MTD011UID: that is yeah i do not know well
[2070.44-2074.90] MTD009PM: because maybe your hand is in the way if you have to display here
[2074.04-2074.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[2078.60-2079.00] MTD009PM: ok
[2079.06-2080.52] MTD011UID: yeah well
[2081.52-2081.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[2086.20-2086.44] MTD011UID: so
[2086.92-2087.92] MTD009PM: yeah
[2091.80-2092.68] MTD009PM: so then we get
[2106.36-2108.38] MTD009PM: yeah this curve
[2116.72-2119.20] MTD012ME: i would not prefer the corners to be round
[2117.24-2118.76] MTD011UID: offments
[2121.02-2121.92] MTD012ME: think that would be better
[2122.80-2129.98] MTD009PM: here display and home buttons and we can have a little bit of here
[2124.36-2125.16] MTD012ME: ruby on the other
[2130.00-2134.20] MTD009PM: here just that is for left hand you might not use it
[2134.14-2134.88] MTD011UID: yeah
[2136.08-2139.56] MTD009PM: and then the rest of the buttons
[2138.92-2144.62] MTD011UID: yeah but the on off button still on the top yeah
[2143.60-2144.98] MTD009PM: yeah so
[2145.84-2146.12] MTD011UID: yeah
[2146.52-2146.86] MTD009PM: yeah
[2149.44-2149.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[2149.88-2151.00] MTD011UID: yeah ok
[2151.20-2153.44] MTD009PM: it is a bit more a bit more friendly
[2155.72-2156.24] MTD009PM: kay
[2157.60-2157.82] MTD0010ID: kay
[2157.60-2160.00] MTD009PM: supplements so
[2160.00-2160.32] MTD009PM: ok
[2161.88-2164.76] MTD009PM: this one does then
[2169.56-2188.20] MTD009PM: we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use so now for the next meeting we will have to look at look at field design it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote so check out the corporate website maybe
[2188.92-2189.96] MTD009PM: the user interface
[2190.00-2207.72] MTD009PM: design it is the same story and product evaluation so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one but you are going to get your instructions i think sent by the coach
[2208.56-2216.44] MTD009PM: so just i will put these minutes on the in the folder
[2212.04-2212.54] MTD012ME: yeah
[2218.60-2220.00] MTD009PM: and then we are going to
[2220.00-2220.28] MTD0010ID: ok
[2220.00-2243.60] MTD009PM: try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers which are let us see i am not sure if you are going to start right away to work together or i think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first and then you will get a message
[2233.60-2233.82] MTD012ME: ok
[2241.48-2241.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[2243.54-2243.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[2244.80-2249.98] MTD009PM: so let us basically maybe this one
[2249.46-2249.88] MTD012ME: ok
[2250.00-2252.40] MTD009PM: i can save this one in the
[2255.92-2256.84] MTD009PM: folders group
[2261.72-2272.36] MTD009PM: alright let us let us see here smartboard there it is so if you want to have a look at it it is over there in the project folder
[2272.22-2272.38] MTD011UID: yeah
[2274.52-2277.64] MTD009PM: and then i guess we will start in thirty minutes again
[2279.28-2279.98] MTD009PM: thank you good
[2280.00-2280.36] MTD011UID: ok

============================================================
SESSION: TS3003d
============================================================

[  11.80-  12.04] MTD009PM: so
[  20.68-  22.20] MTD009PM: so
[  22.96-  28.90] MTD012ME: good afternoon sorry i am a little late i do not want to get stuck in the traffic
[  26.96-  27.56] MTD009PM: oh ok
[  30.00-  44.48] MTD009PM: it is possible that is the end of the day it starts at three o clock yeah let me see our fourth and last meeting
[  37.42-  37.78] MTD012ME: yeah
[  47.72-  48.72] MTD009PM: and there he is
[  52.00-  52.64] MTD009PM: yes
[  55.68-  60.00] MTD009PM: kay this is our last meeting in this meeting we will discuss our final
[  60.00-  80.28] MTD009PM: design and we will do some evaluation about the not only the product but also the project and then we are going to close the project today as well so after that you will be free to go and spend all your money
[  80.96-  89.98] MTD009PM: and this is the design detailed design meeting we all discuss the look and feel of the design the
[  90.00- 100.52] MTD009PM: the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation in order to do that we have this agenda
[ 101.36- 120.00] MTD009PM: we will have the prototype presentation first then we will set up some evaluation criteria then we will look at the finance we will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget because everything costs money and
[ 120.00- 129.00] MTD009PM: the more functions you want to have the more money it will cost so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
[ 129.44- 144.56] MTD009PM: we will see that later then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that we have got forty minutes so we will be finished at half past three but first
[ 145.80- 147.16] MTD009PM: we will do the
[ 150.00- 155.36] MTD009PM: sort of some something like that for it
[ 157.88- 171.44] MTD0010ID: well this is what me and richard came up with the default spot for the on off button the mute button just below that then there is the volume and channel selectors
[ 172.80- 180.00] MTD0010ID: simple plus minus button we thought of a help button if you hold it and you press another button
[ 180.00- 184.60] MTD0010ID: button the help goes to the l c d screen
[ 185.36- 195.48] MTD0010ID: then there is the zero to one to zero buttons a button for teletext a button for the subtitles and the company logo
[ 196.66- 205.08] MTD0010ID: so it is rather a simple prototype and we will have to see from testing how the user is taking
[ 206.28- 206.74] MTD009PM: ok
[ 210.00- 213.36] MTD012ME: is this the moment where we ask where i can ask questions about the functionality
[ 210.88- 211.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 213.76- 216.04] MTD0010ID: sure just pop it at any time
[ 214.00- 214.56] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 216.28- 225.26] MTD012ME: when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you go to the next teletext p page
[ 226.92- 235.16] MTD011UID: it is just the normal just as the normal remote controls so
[ 240.00- 261.56] MTD011UID: hundreds you can use the normal one to zero buttons and you but you can also use the button for changing the the channel s so the shifting button for yeah shif shifting up in on teletext and shifting down so
[ 255.36- 255.68] MTD012ME: ok
[ 262.34- 265.08] MTD012ME: ok
[ 269.20- 270.00] MTD009PM: ok
[ 270.00- 289.14] MTD009PM: but i thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple just a few buttons and large buttons but i think these are altogether quite quite a few buttons
[ 280.20- 280.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 291.08- 295.60] MTD009PM: i am wondering if we if we need really need all of those buttons
[ 297.36- 298.56] MTD0010ID: i think if you look at
[ 300.00- 313.04] MTD0010ID: most controls they have got more buttons than this well the on off button it is it is a necessity to interrupt that one the volume and channel buttons you need you obviously need those those
[ 302.84- 303.40] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 306.60- 306.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 313.44- 313.92] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 314.36- 330.00] MTD0010ID: the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice so we could cancel that one i think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know
[ 326.64- 327.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 330.00- 332.00] MTD0010ID: when someone wants to know what a button does
[ 334.76- 353.32] MTD011UID: or you can build in when you press one button yeah we dis discussed that already but we think all people do not know that option so they just put in would press the button
[ 338.72- 341.28] MTD009PM: blount yeah put
[ 354.72- 356.22] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[ 356.60- 357.96] MTD0010ID: well you can not
[ 359.30- 359.96] MTD0010ID: leave out the
[ 360.00- 361.08] MTD0010ID: number buttons i guess
[ 361.08- 361.36] MTD011UID: no
[ 361.36- 366.08] MTD009PM: yeah oh they are texting some titles here yeah yeah ok
[ 362.64- 363.00] MTD0010ID: and
[ 364.34- 367.76] MTD0010ID: yeah so it is rather basic already
[ 364.68- 364.98] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 365.10- 365.36] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 368.18- 375.78] MTD012ME: yeah i think so that is what i pointed out earlier if you just make a control for just a t v there is just not much to gain here
[ 375.64- 375.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 376.02- 376.40] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 378.04- 383.00] MTD009PM: ok so you had somebody about you want to say something about the design of the buttons there
[ 383.38- 390.00] MTD0010ID: yeah there is not a lot of hard to draw on the whiteboard but they are supposed to be equal sized
[ 384.52- 386.60] MTD009PM: it is normal plain buttons
[ 384.52- 386.16] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 390.00- 399.22] MTD0010ID: rub with with a little logo on it for the m for the volume the the triangle and so it is a recognition
[ 396.20- 398.52] MTD011UID: yeah just to recognize it so
[ 396.54- 398.44] MTD009PM: right ok
[ 399.40- 402.48] MTD011UID: yeah and we do not need a led or
[ 402.82- 403.30] MTD009PM: no
[ 403.56- 413.48] MTD011UID: s some remote controls do have have so but yeah because we use the little display we do not have to use it so
[ 407.12- 407.56] MTD009PM: no
[ 412.94- 414.52] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[ 414.54- 419.88] MTD0010ID: so for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons with a
[ 417.84- 418.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 418.76- 418.96] MTD009PM: yep
[ 420.00- 423.26] MTD0010ID: different color than the case so they jump out
[ 425.16- 443.12] MTD009PM: ok that is fine that is nice then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part which is pretty exciting to see if it is all possible what we want to do and i can tell you
[ 425.30- 426.72] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 445.14- 450.00] MTD009PM: that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this
[ 450.00- 451.84] MTD009PM: for twelve and a half euros
[ 454.20- 465.72] MTD009PM: if we see i do not know if i filled in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong i counted two batteries but maybe we can also use one i do not know if that is something
[ 465.12- 466.24] MTD012ME: since it would be chargeable
[ 466.88- 468.28] MTD009PM: let us recharge it or let us use
[ 467.88- 469.72] MTD011UID: yeah we can use our own
[ 471.60- 479.64] MTD009PM: ok it is two euros up we need the advanced chip so there is not much to
[ 474.76- 475.48] MTD011UID: kay
[ 478.04- 478.44] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 482.04- 494.16] MTD009PM: to save there here we have the single curved we can see that the difference between uncurved and single curved is one euro
[ 495.68- 507.72] MTD009PM: i do not know but i think the single curved is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control i think we have to keep that
[ 500.36- 500.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 505.84- 506.24] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 507.60- 507.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 508.92- 510.00] MTD009PM: then we have the
[ 510.00- 522.48] MTD009PM: case material supplements it is plastic it is the cheapest one we need so that is not much to save either but then the biggest costs are the buttons
[ 523.10- 539.22] MTD009PM: so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low because we will have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end
[ 527.02- 527.68] MTD011UID: ok
[ 540.92- 552.82] MTD009PM: so if we let us fr first count the buttons we have now cause i am sixteen now that will be even more than eighteen euros
[ 543.36- 543.72] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 545.06- 546.40] MTD011UID: six hundred so
[ 556.26- 556.96] MTD009PM: so
[ 556.46- 557.36] MTD011UID: it is fifteen
[ 558.36- 559.04] MTD009PM: seven
[ 559.58- 560.74] MTD011UID: yeah with the help of button
[ 562.20- 569.74] MTD009PM: ok including the help yeah seventeen i think we can discard the help and the mute button
[ 562.32- 562.60] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 563.04- 563.42] MTD012ME: ok
[ 563.58- 563.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 570.92- 575.76] MTD009PM: by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number
[ 577.12- 577.32] MTD0010ID: yep
[ 577.58- 583.48] MTD009PM: long that saves us one euro already cause then we have got fifteen i think
[ 583.28- 583.54] MTD0010ID: yep
[ 584.80- 587.36] MTD012ME: would not
[ 585.68- 587.28] MTD009PM: i think that is
[ 589.12- 589.82] MTD009PM: and this is
[ 589.28- 594.36] MTD012ME: but i assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each right
[ 594.60- 596.40] MTD009PM: no those are one i think
[ 595.76- 596.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 597.68- 600.00] MTD012ME: i think actually there are two buttons
[ 597.96- 598.80] MTD011UID: actually there are two but
[ 599.56- 600.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 600.00- 603.28] MTD011UID: it is just one button but
[ 604.48- 614.96] MTD011UID: two f one big button but they are more expensive than the small ones i so
[ 614.40- 625.82] MTD009PM: yeah but it is not staggered in this slide so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
[ 616.46- 619.22] MTD011UID: it is just a reference
[ 625.08- 628.92] MTD012ME: well i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
[ 630.46- 631.88] MTD009PM: that is a possibility as well
[ 632.08- 634.02] MTD012ME: that would cut the costs
[ 634.96- 638.32] MTD009PM: so and it is good for the design as well so you can make
[ 639.82- 643.54] MTD009PM: let us see if you make this
[ 661.40- 662.84] MTD009PM: it is good like that
[ 664.32- 666.04] MTD009PM: cross
[ 670.56- 672.24] MTD009PM: yes maybe
[ 674.62- 684.94] MTD011UID: but i do not do not know if if it is cheaper so we still got four buttons but just so
[ 677.32- 679.96] MTD009PM: yeah yeah yeah i would
[ 685.02- 687.56] MTD009PM: yeah i think they count the the materials
[ 687.38- 690.00] MTD011UID: we got not not a better better it is still
[ 690.00- 698.60] MTD011UID: but on the yeah on the chip you got still for for buttons though
[ 692.80- 694.60] MTD009PM: on the chip yeah
[ 694.60- 694.92] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 696.42- 697.60] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 698.44- 698.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 698.92- 706.04] MTD009PM: but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button but no but i think
[ 701.88- 702.64] MTD011UID: yeah but
[ 705.64- 708.48] MTD012ME: but i think this really is for buttons anyway
[ 709.18- 709.68] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 711.72- 720.00] MTD009PM: yeah maybe it is but then it seems to me that it is impossible to live with itself in half euros
[ 720.00- 731.64] MTD009PM: also the l c display i think it is just i think it is too expensive for the display we use i think they sorry
[ 721.44- 722.00] MTD012ME: yes
[ 723.84- 725.32] MTD0010ID: no that is that is a big cost
[ 731.68- 735.88] MTD0010ID: if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
[ 737.90- 745.34] MTD009PM: that is right but what is the big advantage of our remote then
[ 745.40- 746.88] MTD012ME: only the docking station i guess
[ 747.80- 748.32] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 749.86- 750.00] MTD0010ID: with
[ 750.00- 754.02] MTD0010ID: is not the the docking station is not even in this s schematic
[ 755.42- 758.00] MTD0010ID: so it is not even taken into the price
[ 755.42- 759.92] MTD009PM: no it is extra that is extra it is where
[ 760.80- 762.46] MTD012ME: maybe we should move to a different supplier
[ 764.16- 779.98] MTD009PM: it is an option or something or you sh do not you think we can if we can count this as b as one button and integrate the these buttons in three
[ 768.28- 768.76] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 780.00- 783.36] MTD009PM: and then you save a lot of money as well
[ 782.98- 789.08] MTD0010ID: we could save money on it but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
[ 790.00- 792.12] MTD012ME: yeah that is what i am going to have
[ 791.60- 794.32] MTD0010ID: my mother can not even send send an s m s message
[ 795.54- 796.08] MTD0010ID: so
[ 795.72- 797.28] MTD009PM: yeah it is a play
[ 798.12- 798.68] MTD012ME: oh yeah
[ 798.52- 804.00] MTD011UID: we can not buy a a remote control when you can use it so
[ 805.84- 806.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 807.96- 810.00] MTD011UID: we we must
[ 810.00- 819.02] MTD011UID: stay below the below twelve fifty or you can not go
[ 816.60- 816.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 819.44- 819.82] MTD009PM: but
[ 821.56- 823.40] MTD012ME: well since the market research
[ 824.52- 837.16] MTD012ME: indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it is feasible to just p put the price of the remote up a little especially since we have those nice features
[ 838.22- 839.98] MTD009PM: yeah but we have
[ 840.00- 850.38] MTD009PM: to stick to the twelve and a half euros we do not have any more budget to yeah
[ 845.38- 847.40] MTD0010ID: the margin yeah
[ 845.64- 846.56] MTD011UID: but is it possible to
[ 849.78- 853.10] MTD011UID: but is it possible to make one for twelve fifty
[ 854.06- 854.84] MTD011UID: i do not think so
[ 854.52- 861.88] MTD009PM: it is if you if you have the l c d display and if you use less buttons
[ 855.26- 857.60] MTD012ME: if you if you have the r c d display
[ 856.52- 856.80] MTD011UID: so
[ 860.44- 860.72] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 863.08- 868.24] MTD009PM: say how you can use a single chip
[ 864.44- 864.72] MTD0010ID: two
[ 864.76- 867.64] MTD011UID: but i can not use
[ 871.26- 874.46] MTD009PM: where it is
[ 872.36- 872.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 875.48- 877.00] MTD011UID: whatever you want to make a
[ 877.72- 878.76] MTD009PM: the
[ 878.28- 883.24] MTD011UID: so fancy and good yeah
[ 883.92- 884.64] MTD009PM: right here
[ 884.40- 887.08] MTD011UID: with
[ 889.12- 889.46] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 889.32- 896.08] MTD011UID: attractive option so you can stay below twelve fifty so
[ 896.24- 898.38] MTD009PM: i think it is difficult as well
[ 896.60- 896.92] MTD012ME: well
[ 898.32- 900.00] MTD012ME: basically it becomes a choice between the
[ 900.00- 909.14] MTD012ME: like either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control
[ 907.20- 908.60] MTD0010ID: no remote
[ 909.76- 916.04] MTD009PM: or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers
[ 917.52- 918.62] MTD011UID: it is cool this one
[ 917.74- 918.14] MTD009PM: or
[ 918.96- 929.98] MTD009PM: because then we save ten buttons and we have five and one and let us see this one and we have got the
[ 919.24- 919.76] MTD0010ID: that is n
[ 919.64- 920.10] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 921.64- 921.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 930.00- 930.72] MTD009PM: scrolls
[ 933.80- 936.76] MTD009PM: ok we are getting closer
[ 934.30- 935.36] MTD0010ID: we are getting closer
[ 935.76- 936.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 938.18- 940.16] MTD012ME: but how would a scroll wheel work here
[ 943.16- 944.20] MTD009PM: then we will
[ 948.16- 949.56] MTD009PM: or maybe you can
[ 952.16- 958.92] MTD009PM: scroll if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l c d display until you have got the right number that you can
[ 958.92- 959.16] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 960.00- 960.60] MTD009PM: you push it
[ 961.44- 964.46] MTD012ME: that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also
[ 965.64- 972.88] MTD009PM: oh yeah it is like scroll push ok but then you you can push some other buttons and
[ 965.74- 969.24] MTD012ME: and create a scroll wheel and push push button but yeah
[ 973.80- 976.08] MTD0010ID: you could just not scroll for half a second
[ 976.68- 982.88] MTD009PM: yeah so that is right if you scroll up the number and then you wait a half second then it turns to the channel
[ 977.48- 979.14] MTD0010ID: so you want to need a button
[ 982.58- 985.24] MTD012ME: i think that would be like the end of our usability
[ 985.70- 987.26] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 987.62- 989.98] MTD009PM: that would definitely
[ 990.00- 996.34] MTD009PM: crop cost also we need battery
[ 991.88- 992.40] MTD012ME: yeah
[1001.16-1005.40] MTD009PM: and the regular chip is not possible it has to be advanced
[1006.80-1010.44] MTD0010ID: if you want to use an l c d screen you you need an advanced chip yeah
[1008.78-1016.74] MTD009PM: yes ok now we can save a euro by a flat design
[1020.00-1025.12] MTD009PM: that is an option we can yep then we are almost there
[1021.28-1021.50] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1026.12-1029.44] MTD0010ID: yeah if we if we could just leave out one more button
[1030.78-1032.96] MTD009PM: yeah so if we
[1033.24-1036.44] MTD011UID: yeah or we have to skip the subtitle button
[1036.60-1037.04] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1037.12-1040.84] MTD009PM: yeah but i think that is that is a bigger function for the
[1037.52-1038.68] MTD011UID: sub yeah
[1040.40-1044.42] MTD011UID: yeah it is a big advantage but it is
[1042.22-1042.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[1043.76-1047.80] MTD009PM: can we use can we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button
[1048.44-1049.56] MTD0010ID: fix it yeah
[1048.56-1049.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[1049.80-1050.00] MTD012ME: oh
[1049.86-1050.00] MTD009PM: oh
[1050.00-1051.80] MTD009PM: you push it yeah
[1050.00-1060.60] MTD012ME: i think it is pretty much teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight eight eight and teletext disappears but the subtitles stay there
[1051.40-1051.86] MTD011UID: yeah
[1057.16-1057.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[1057.72-1058.02] MTD011UID: yeah
[1061.64-1064.08] MTD011UID: but if you push the button twice
[1062.40-1063.68] MTD012ME: yeah that is the case i am not
[1064.90-1070.14] MTD0010ID: what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight eight hundred eighty eight
[1065.92-1066.22] MTD011UID: yeah
[1068.92-1071.80] MTD011UID: one b one b a few bit
[1069.00-1070.24] MTD009PM: yeah that is
[1069.64-1074.98] MTD012ME: well that could be just yeah scroll to the eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
[1075.12-1076.16] MTD0010ID: yeah ok
[1076.92-1079.98] MTD012ME: but then again there would be that is just pretty much normal option
[1080.00-1083.76] MTD012ME: for older people who do not even know what a scroll wheel is
[1082.28-1083.00] MTD0010ID: do not even know what a
[1085.36-1086.04] MTD012ME: holding a
[1087.80-1093.48] MTD012ME: a remote with with respect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
[1096.36-1097.62] MTD012ME: with only five buttons on it
[1099.76-1100.52] MTD012ME: and a scroll wheel
[1101.88-1109.98] MTD009PM: i think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the
[1110.00-1114.60] MTD009PM: in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel
[1115.84-1117.40] MTD009PM: you just make it real simple
[1120.92-1130.96] MTD009PM: because it saves it saves a lot of money and we can keep our l c d screen which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel how to use the other buttons as subtitles
[1128.74-1129.60] MTD012ME: true
[1133.20-1139.98] MTD009PM: and it is good for the innovative design as well if you want to raise the
[1140.00-1140.54] MTD009PM: so
[1142.68-1144.56] MTD009PM: ok
[1157.60-1159.08] MTD009PM: and it is
[1167.04-1169.70] MTD009PM: looks a bit off maybe
[1170.00-1171.44] MTD012ME: that is a pretty big school
[1182.00-1182.68] MTD009PM: i do not see anything
[1191.12-1200.00] MTD009PM: something like that yeah you can scroll down one two three four five letters
[1200.00-1203.00] MTD009PM: if we if we do it this one
[1215.16-1216.60] MTD009PM: i need to click the button so
[1227.24-1230.00] MTD0010ID: we could make two buttons out of this
[1230.00-1232.92] MTD0010ID: that and just
[1234.32-1238.18] MTD0010ID: if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
[1236.16-1236.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[1239.88-1242.90] MTD0010ID: so that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel
[1241.90-1242.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[1243.84-1247.04] MTD009PM: that is really a good good idea i think
[1252.00-1257.42] MTD009PM: and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious and neat
[1255.42-1256.16] MTD0010ID: more obvious
[1259.80-1259.98] MTD009PM: s
[1260.00-1264.40] MTD009PM: so we make one and volume one is the general
[1271.84-1282.48] MTD009PM: let us scroll that is right so we have got one two three yeah we can leave the teletext in if we want
[1274.98-1275.82] MTD0010ID: so if we try
[1282.78-1284.24] MTD0010ID: yeah so it is
[1283.60-1284.84] MTD009PM: let us move to the other
[1284.98-1286.20] MTD012ME: so this was five dollars
[1285.76-1289.98] MTD0010ID: if we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat
[1290.00-1293.50] MTD0010ID: flat case and make it smaller overall
[1295.20-1304.92] MTD0010ID: so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right beh under that then the scroll button
[1295.28-1295.80] MTD009PM: yeah
[1301.84-1302.40] MTD009PM: yeah
[1305.24-1306.88] MTD009PM: yeah you can
[1306.24-1308.00] MTD0010ID: you will get a a much smaller remote
[1308.12-1308.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[1308.48-1309.04] MTD009PM: that is right
[1310.28-1310.56] MTD0010ID: and it
[1311.40-1312.00] MTD009PM: sure
[1311.60-1311.92] MTD0010ID: s
[1313.32-1316.00] MTD009PM: we will decrease this more to more buttons
[1317.06-1317.40] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1317.64-1318.84] MTD012ME: i know you are fine
[1318.40-1319.96] MTD011UID: but we can make a
[1320.00-1333.74] MTD011UID: quite big remote control for just the same price as the small one just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved it is a bit
[1327.12-1328.64] MTD009PM: yeah it is a it is a
[1332.20-1332.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[1334.10-1349.32] MTD009PM: yeah it is it is more the molds in which they are being made i think single curved is pretty easy to just fill in and the cases come right out of the machine and single curved you have to have a different thing with the machine and then the flat one
[1350.88-1354.24] MTD009PM: i think this is a really easy one
[1355.72-1363.68] MTD009PM: what does everybody think about a flap or a single curved design ok so what do you think
[1364.74-1370.06] MTD012ME: well i still think we should go for the single curved design but then again i mean
[1368.00-1368.40] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1369.98-1372.24] MTD0010ID: richard argument was very weak yeah
[1370.88-1376.00] MTD012ME: all these changes are not really ok with me but since
[1371.00-1371.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[1371.48-1371.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[1373.88-1374.24] MTD009PM: yeah
[1377.08-1380.00] MTD009PM: you have to cut costs yeah
[1377.68-1378.64] MTD012ME: we just have to
[1380.00-1381.32] MTD009PM: yeah i wrote
[1380.96-1382.56] MTD012ME: i would rather just go to the board and
[1384.48-1385.44] MTD009PM: hals from the mic
[1384.90-1387.82] MTD012ME: get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote
[1386.94-1387.32] MTD009PM: yeah
[1388.52-1390.76] MTD009PM: yeah i am agree with you next minute
[1389.28-1392.28] MTD012ME: or do some market research and see what the options are
[1393.80-1410.00] MTD009PM: yeah but i think we can keep the single curved one just to express our l c d screen a bit more so people will use it more and especially for the help functions it will be good if we have scroll bar
[1403.40-1403.68] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1403.40-1403.72] MTD012ME: yeah
[1410.00-1415.84] MTD009PM: a scroll button it will be necessary to have a good count function as well
[1423.84-1425.52] MTD009PM: so scroll
[1437.52-1440.00] MTD009PM: to have this price list a bit early
[1440.00-1444.12] MTD009PM: before we went on to the to the whole design
[1440.44-1442.04] MTD012ME: yes definitely
[1441.64-1442.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[1445.56-1445.84] MTD009PM: but
[1446.94-1448.52] MTD009PM: i think we have to make a bit
[1450.52-1450.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[1451.38-1454.86] MTD009PM: that is pretty different pretty different than this one
[1452.80-1461.52] MTD012ME: it is pretty different this is not really like for the group you were making on the remote this will really require a lot of marketing
[1462.52-1463.56] MTD009PM: yeah the
[1463.24-1464.82] MTD012ME: to get this to sell
[1465.64-1465.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[1468.00-1469.98] MTD012ME: cause older people like
[1470.00-1474.26] MTD012ME: familiar forms and familiar stuff this is not familiar for them
[1475.66-1476.76] MTD009PM: no but i think
[1476.16-1478.32] MTD012ME: so we are going to have to do a lot of convincing then
[1478.24-1479.08] MTD009PM: i think the most
[1479.24-1488.46] MTD011UID: but they know the scroll buttons from old radios they c also buttons like that for changing channels so maybe it is
[1485.52-1485.96] MTD012ME: yeah yeah
[1485.54-1499.98] MTD009PM: yeah we can we can stick it out like a old old button maybe that is recognizable for them as well yeah that is a good one so
[1491.44-1492.56] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[1496.68-1496.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[1500.00-1514.64] MTD009PM: i am afraid we have to move on and it is it is less frightening i think if they see this design and think oh there are only five buttons and then we will
[1513.68-1514.04] MTD011UID: ok
[1513.88-1515.80] MTD012ME: that is true might it might be confusing too
[1516.16-1518.04] MTD009PM: yeah that is good yeah
[1517.20-1519.08] MTD012ME: they could like what only five buttons
[1517.24-1517.76] MTD011UID: it is like
[1520.24-1520.64] MTD009PM: yeah
[1521.56-1523.28] MTD011UID: that is very special so
[1524.96-1527.52] MTD009PM: i would buy it
[1527.12-1529.44] MTD012ME: yeah but you are not sixty
[1528.28-1529.96] MTD009PM: that is right i would buy it
[1530.00-1536.36] MTD009PM: the evalances no i do not know are they cost under twelve and a half euros no
[1537.54-1539.40] MTD009PM: yes they are
[1540.00-1541.62] MTD011UID: no
[1540.66-1545.90] MTD009PM: no but we can go on with the project evaluation
[1549.64-1555.20] MTD009PM: that is it ok so we still have fifteen minutes left so it is nice on schedule
[1555.76-1556.32] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1557.32-1560.00] MTD009PM: it is the project process
[1560.00-1560.16] MTD009PM: s
[1560.26-1563.92] MTD012ME: so i would like to set up all these criteria
[1564.62-1566.42] MTD012ME: and evaluation of the
[1564.74-1569.72] MTD009PM: evaluation continuum that is right that was the thingy of the point i forgot
[1568.06-1568.46] MTD012ME: thingy
[1570.72-1571.28] MTD009PM: if you should
[1573.08-1585.86] MTD009PM: there we are evaluation continuum we have got five minutes i think for this continuum no we have got fifteen minutes but
[1575.64-1577.36] MTD012ME: thank you
[1582.24-1583.40] MTD012ME: five more minutes
[1585.68-1586.16] MTD012ME: ok
[1596.54-1597.44] MTD009PM: yes
[1603.10-1608.64] MTD012ME: kay so i did some literature studi study analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
[1608.98-1609.40] MTD009PM: yeah
[1609.70-1620.00] MTD012ME: translated it into criteria which would be these is the remote fancy the shape look and feel innovative what new functions are
[1620.00-1622.32] MTD012ME: there easy to use
[1623.60-1638.24] MTD012ME: learnability is a very important factor here is it functional are there not too many functions amount of functions and are the those functions that are there are they useful the cost
[1640.80-1649.98] MTD012ME: the target group is the remote really for the group we are making it for and recordability
[1650.00-1655.36] MTD012ME: if our company is if it is easily recognizable that our company made it
[1659.02-1660.80] MTD012ME: so we are supposed to evaluate it right now
[1661.82-1662.16] MTD009PM: ok
[1664.24-1664.72] MTD012ME: let us see
[1667.40-1672.60] MTD012ME: oh i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
[1673.72-1674.24] MTD012ME: were not here
[1674.18-1680.00] MTD009PM: yeah that is because my pen failed to upload this data i tried to
[1678.00-1678.44] MTD012ME: ok
[1678.16-1678.88] MTD011UID: yeah
[1679.48-1680.00] MTD012ME: which
[1680.00-1684.08] MTD009PM: but it is it is giving errors by downloading the software
[1683.32-1684.92] MTD012ME: so
[1684.08-1686.98] MTD011UID: kay
[1687.16-1690.00] MTD012ME: is the design fancy on a scale of one to seven
[1690.36-1691.50] MTD009PM: i think it is fancy
[1692.56-1693.14] MTD0010ID: six
[1693.44-1693.60] MTD009PM: yeah
[1694.28-1695.36] MTD011UID: yeah six
[1694.52-1696.60] MTD012ME: zero to six
[1695.26-1695.64] MTD009PM: six
[1701.04-1703.92] MTD012ME: is the design innovative
[1704.36-1710.00] MTD009PM: very sure subtitles buttons yeah
[1704.44-1706.10] MTD011UID: yeah
[1705.08-1709.28] MTD012ME: i think so if our l c d c d documents and scroll buttons
[1709.82-1710.00] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1710.00-1717.64] MTD009PM: seven yeah so we have got twenty cents for our docking station
[1711.04-1711.40] MTD012ME: seven
[1711.66-1711.88] MTD011UID: yeah
[1718.72-1721.80] MTD012ME: should be the one is the design easy to use
[1719.48-1720.56] MTD009PM: yeah that is right
[1722.40-1723.56] MTD011UID: not already
[1723.10-1725.78] MTD009PM: alright it is a bit dodgy
[1725.62-1726.18] MTD012ME: well
[1727.80-1729.02] MTD012ME: would be for us but
[1729.72-1731.00] MTD011UID: four or five
[1730.38-1735.28] MTD009PM: i would say four four or five four or five between four four five
[1732.08-1733.20] MTD0010ID: four or five
[1732.16-1734.40] MTD011UID: four or five yeah four
[1735.80-1736.66] MTD012ME: i would go for fourteen
[1736.64-1736.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[1736.92-1737.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[1741.40-1742.36] MTD009PM: is it functional
[1742.72-1747.14] MTD012ME: is the design functional do we have all functions that we want to include
[1747.80-1748.48] MTD009PM: yes
[1748.14-1748.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[1748.48-1753.20] MTD012ME: think we do do we have too many functions no i do not think so it is pretty sweet
[1750.88-1751.32] MTD0010ID: no
[1751.28-1751.76] MTD009PM: no
[1752.88-1754.08] MTD009PM: i think it is seven
[1755.64-1756.00] MTD012ME: seven
[1758.44-1759.90] MTD012ME: oh and do we
[1762.00-1768.30] MTD012ME: take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control like getting lost and
[1769.84-1770.00] MTD012ME: it
[1769.88-1770.00] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1770.00-1771.48] MTD0010ID: so i have not thought of that one
[1770.00-1770.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[1770.00-1773.50] MTD012ME: is it a photo card or two pieces what do you do
[1772.36-1775.14] MTD009PM: it was i had them worked out
[1777.76-1782.76] MTD009PM: they are ugly not very functional and getting lost
[1785.12-1788.48] MTD012ME: and the production costs within the preset limits well they are now
[1785.28-1785.66] MTD011UID: yeah
[1789.64-1789.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[1795.00-1796.98] MTD012ME: does the design fit the group of focus
[1798.52-1800.00] MTD0010ID: i think that is a three
[1798.80-1799.98] MTD011UID: that is a free
[1800.00-1800.56] MTD011UID: yeah
[1800.32-1802.30] MTD012ME: yeah i think that is a good idea
[1800.96-1804.96] MTD009PM: no i think with our new radio button i think it is
[1802.72-1803.04] MTD011UID: yeah
[1806.00-1806.80] MTD009PM: i think it is better
[1807.48-1809.56] MTD011UID: we have to test it but
[1808.16-1808.78] MTD012ME: oh no
[1809.72-1815.84] MTD0010ID: i still i think it is too too fancy too too flashy
[1810.90-1811.28] MTD012ME: i think
[1811.68-1812.02] MTD009PM: i think it is
[1815.18-1820.34] MTD012ME: i think the radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control
[1820.36-1821.52] MTD011UID: yeah true
[1823.92-1824.96] MTD009PM: i will give it a four
[1829.88-1830.00] MTD012ME: oh
[1830.00-1831.72] MTD012ME: not sure i think i have to go for a t
[1832.16-1833.80] MTD011UID: i go for three so
[1833.66-1836.40] MTD009PM: then we have to do the three step
[1835.64-1835.96] MTD012ME: ok
[1843.52-1847.38] MTD012ME: is c c be c can not be recognized more yeah we have to load on there
[1845.84-1847.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[1846.00-1846.58] MTD011UID: yeah
[1848.82-1849.14] MTD012ME: sorry
[1852.48-1860.00] MTD009PM: they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company and we have the removed
[1860.00-1865.42] MTD009PM: ball front cases so i think it is very recognizable yeah
[1862.16-1862.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[1862.62-1862.92] MTD012ME: yeah
[1870.36-1871.40] MTD012ME: so i do not think that is
[1875.48-1877.62] MTD012ME: i was also supposed to calculate the score but
[1879.04-1883.52] MTD012ME: thought we would have another private thingy after this
[1881.92-1883.02] MTD009PM: we have got a coconut
[1885.30-1888.04] MTD0010ID: do not know
[1886.12-1888.08] MTD012ME: is this like after this will be done or
[1889.14-1890.00] MTD009PM: we have got a
[1889.64-1890.00] MTD012ME: yeah
[1890.00-1891.60] MTD009PM: go to tell you it
[1890.00-1891.00] MTD012ME: to where it would be
[1892.54-1895.68] MTD012ME: well i have these are sub effectors times seven is four b
[1897.08-1898.08] MTD012ME: something three two
[1899.26-1900.04] MTD012ME: n nine
[1900.92-1901.60] MTD009PM: forty nine
[1902.44-1903.56] MTD012ME: and minus one
[1906.98-1909.64] MTD012ME: minus three
[1910.90-1911.56] MTD012ME: minus four
[1913.32-1915.00] MTD012ME: so it will be minus eight
[1916.36-1918.34] MTD012ME: forty one out of forty nine
[1916.94-1917.50] MTD009PM: forty one
[1919.70-1919.98] MTD009PM: the
[1920.00-1920.36] MTD009PM: saint
[1925.88-1927.68] MTD009PM: and eighty percent
[1926.12-1926.68] MTD012ME: ok
[1928.56-1931.34] MTD012ME: i guess we will just put that away button button
[1934.62-1937.36] MTD009PM: that is eighty four percent
[1943.00-1945.32] MTD009PM: i think that is a pretty nice score
[1943.00-1943.60] MTD011UID: i think it is
[1945.66-1945.94] MTD0010ID: yeah
[1957.44-1961.72] MTD012ME: kay so that would be the upload function

[1992.16-1992.60] MTD009PM: that is right
[1993.40-1994.42] MTD012ME: in the design phase
[1995.22-1997.92] MTD009PM: so lack of information about prices
[1998.36-1998.56] MTD012ME: yeah
[1998.52-2000.38] MTD0010ID: yeah that is true

[2021.82-2024.18] MTD0010ID: yeah there was enough room for the finance and
[2022.78-2023.52] MTD012ME: yeah true but
[2023.94-2025.20] MTD009PM: the room was yeah
[2024.40-2024.72] MTD011UID: almost
[2029.86-2031.56] MTD012ME: and i would have liked to go for the
[2032.74-2034.20] MTD012ME: younger users also
[2036.38-2038.32] MTD012ME: and just to be able to access internet and
[2040.00-2040.98] MTD012ME: get something of your own
[2044.16-2045.30] MTD009PM: districtions
[2049.84-2050.92] MTD009PM: internet access
[2053.32-2062.92] MTD009PM: kay leadership was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions
[2064.36-2064.84] MTD0010ID: yeah
[2064.36-2064.60] MTD009PM: yeah
[2064.36-2064.58] MTD012ME: yeah
[2066.54-2070.00] MTD009PM: teamwork did it work out working together also
[2067.04-2067.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[2070.00-2072.82] MTD009PM: you to view with the last page
[2071.48-2072.16] MTD0010ID: yeah it was ok
[2072.20-2072.54] MTD011UID: yeah
[2074.64-2075.24] MTD009PM: nice
[2081.14-2086.86] MTD0010ID: the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it is very easy
[2089.82-2090.32] MTD009PM: tasks
[2091.80-2092.14] MTD009PM: ok
[2093.64-2098.52] MTD009PM: were the means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do or were they too much
[2099.52-2099.98] MTD0010ID: oh
[2100.00-2103.94] MTD0010ID: the smart board the the the drawing is just a pain in the ass but
[2105.36-2106.16] MTD009PM: smartboard
[2105.52-2107.74] MTD0010ID: the dint the pen is very nice
[2107.64-2107.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[2108.72-2112.28] MTD009PM: if it wants to download this data
[2109.10-2111.20] MTD012ME: you have to download this yeah
[2109.30-2109.52] MTD011UID: but
[2110.56-2111.24] MTD0010ID: yeah
[2111.20-2111.70] MTD011UID: data
[2117.92-2119.24] MTD009PM: four
[2123.84-2127.20] MTD009PM: smartboard was irritating
[2132.84-2138.62] MTD009PM: so you rather wanted to have a flip over or something flip over
[2138.10-2141.08] MTD0010ID: flip over or more precise
[2138.40-2140.18] MTD011UID: yeah for the presentation
[2141.52-2141.78] MTD011UID: yeah
[2142.04-2142.32] MTD012ME: yeah
[2142.32-2144.54] MTD009PM: faster and smaller things yeah
[2142.62-2143.60] MTD0010ID: yeah
[2149.52-2150.06] MTD009PM: oh ok
[2150.08-2159.98] MTD011UID: but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation
[2160.00-2173.36] MTD011UID: it is easier to share it with other people so you can save it and put it on the internet or in shared folder or shared directory so
[2164.00-2164.34] MTD009PM: yep
[2172.64-2175.72] MTD012ME: yeah i tried to open the file on my laptop but
[2174.52-2176.44] MTD011UID: so yeah
[2175.74-2176.90] MTD0010ID: no it did not work
[2176.94-2177.62] MTD012ME: not possible
[2177.28-2181.20] MTD009PM: you need the smartboard location i think
[2179.80-2180.12] MTD012ME: yeah
[2182.20-2185.72] MTD011UID: can can you export it like yeah
[2182.60-2187.60] MTD009PM: but i think you can yeah should be possible yeah you can export this image
[2185.24-2185.76] MTD012ME: yeah
[2188.66-2190.00] MTD009PM: just yeah just the
[2190.00-2190.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[2190.00-2190.96] MTD012ME: you should have done that then
[2193.72-2196.74] MTD009PM: so the sharing of the information was was ok
[2198.10-2198.64] MTD012ME: teletext
[2198.64-2199.16] MTD0010ID: yeah sure
[2198.64-2201.40] MTD009PM: yeah yeah pennies here on the table
[2198.92-2199.32] MTD011UID: yeah
[2206.88-2208.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[2211.44-2213.44] MTD011UID: so yeah
[2212.56-2216.16] MTD009PM: yeah the m p the m p it is possible
[2215.44-2216.52] MTD012ME: yeah it is possible yeah
[2215.56-2216.20] MTD011UID: it is possible
[2217.60-2217.96] MTD009PM: ok
[2218.92-2219.24] MTD011UID: kay
[2220.26-2223.84] MTD009PM: it is nice have we found new ideas for
[2225.52-2227.54] MTD009PM: having this kind of meeting so
[2228.28-2238.88] MTD011UID: yeah maybe when we n just give the numbers of of
[2240.16-2250.00] MTD011UID: a one of out of service it is easier to to do th th things like that on the computer
[2243.30-2243.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[2250.00-2255.60] MTD011UID: or so just like like the university
[2250.88-2251.18] MTD009PM: yeah
[2253.00-2253.28] MTD009PM: so
[2256.08-2267.60] MTD009PM: yeah so everybody puts his own score and then it mediates the score and you can get one yeah that is better so it is
[2256.74-2256.92] MTD011UID: so
[2257.04-2257.44] MTD012ME: yeah
[2258.52-2258.98] MTD011UID: yeah
[2259.26-2259.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[2261.72-2262.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[2269.02-2269.80] MTD009PM: how do we go
[2281.36-2281.96] MTD009PM: right
[2284.64-2285.48] MTD009PM: right here we are
[2294.80-2295.40] MTD009PM: ok
[2296.68-2301.88] MTD009PM: any more ideas or questions about the project or about the product
[2308.36-2310.00] MTD009PM: of course i think
[2310.00-2310.28] MTD009PM: yeah
[2315.00-2318.42] MTD009PM: then let me get to our last sheet
[2320.98-2322.24] MTD009PM: articles within the budget
[2323.40-2323.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[2324.36-2324.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[2324.90-2325.32] MTD012ME: they are
[2326.34-2330.24] MTD0010ID: considering we are not going to make a docking station
[2326.48-2327.36] MTD009PM: still
[2330.04-2339.42] MTD009PM: docking station that is the point that maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
[2340.68-2341.04] MTD012ME: yeah
[2341.48-2344.60] MTD009PM: and i think you can compensate that as well
[2341.56-2342.00] MTD0010ID: right
[2345.88-2350.52] MTD009PM: so i think that should not be the biggest problem because it is very cheap to make as well
[2351.60-2351.98] MTD011UID: yes
[2352.06-2369.96] MTD009PM: do we think we are going to get the twelve and a half million or was it fifteen fifteen million i think we will if we are going to export this product it is innovative especially in america people are pretty decadent
[2356.56-2357.68] MTD012ME: fifty fifty
[2364.32-2364.58] MTD012ME: yeah
[2369.56-2370.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[2371.18-2371.84] MTD009PM: sometimes
[2372.64-2376.26] MTD012ME: yeah i still do not think i mean if we are going to make a scroll button anyway
[2373.12-2373.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[2378.12-2379.22] MTD009PM: can be more
[2378.14-2384.06] MTD012ME: it would be more for the younger people than for the older people yeah so maybe we should just refocus
[2381.84-2382.16] MTD009PM: yeah
[2381.92-2382.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[2385.16-2399.98] MTD009PM: just put it on the market for everybody you can you can change markets where by changing the front cover that is one thing you can change it so you can also try to
[2387.96-2390.04] MTD012ME: ok specifically for younger people
[2394.12-2394.28] MTD011UID: ok
[2395.04-2395.64] MTD012ME: let us change it
[2400.00-2409.60] MTD009PM: reach the younger people by putting fancy colors on on the mark just as a test see how it works that is i think a good advantage
[2409.18-2417.58] MTD012ME: yeah i think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is than it would be with
[2419.22-2419.96] MTD012ME: older people
[2420.40-2420.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[2421.64-2423.24] MTD012ME: even if it were their covers
[2423.84-2428.88] MTD009PM: well then i think we can have a little celebration right now
[2425.56-2426.48] MTD012ME: yeah
[2430.08-2439.08] MTD009PM: that is it i think we still have some time and more more question and i think i do not know i did not get a message
[2430.36-2431.24] MTD012ME: party party
[2434.10-2434.96] MTD011UID: ok
