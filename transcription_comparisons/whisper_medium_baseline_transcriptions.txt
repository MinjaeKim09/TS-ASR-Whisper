[  420.00-  425.00] FEO070: observations and then we have the interlinking by right click basically
[  420.00-  425.00] FEO072: observations and then we have the interlinking by right click basically
[  420.00-  425.00] MEE071: observations and then we have the interlinking by right click basically

[  917.52-  925.00] FEO072: yeah if you get results for the same meeting yeah exactly so the summary and the topic and the transcript
[  917.52-  925.00] MEE071: yeah if you get results for the same meeting yeah exactly so the summary and the topic and the transcript

[  932.00-  936.00] FEO070: i mean we could order them by meeting for example
[  932.00-  936.00] FEO072: i mean we could order them by meeting for example
[  932.00-  936.00] MEE071: i mean we could order them by meeting for example
[  932.00-  936.00] MEE073: i mean we could order them by meeting for example
[  936.00-  940.00] FEO070: oh yeah i guess that is the other thing whether we want to have us reorder by call or something
[  936.00-  940.00] FEO072: oh yeah i guess that is the other thing whether we want to have us reorder by call or something

[  940.00-  945.00] FEO070: yeah well i mean that is the second step the first question is do we want to order them
[  940.00-  945.00] FEO072: yeah well i mean that is the second step the first question is do we want to order them
[  940.00-  945.00] MEE071: yeah well i mean that is the second step the first question is do we want to order them

[ 1369.36- 1378.08] FEO070: yeah but then you know the good way of doing it not together is that you
[ 1369.36- 1378.08] FEO072: yeah but then you know the good way of doing it not together is that you
[ 1369.36- 1378.08] MEE071: yeah but then you know the good way of doing it not together is that you

[ 1380.00- 1385.00] FEO070: the chop file and you do not ever have to produce it
[ 1380.00- 1385.00] FEO072: the chop file and you do not ever have to produce it

[ 1385.00- 1390.00] FEO070: but i mean you can write something like
[ 1385.00- 1390.00] FEO072: but i mean you can write something like
[ 1385.00- 1390.00] MEE071: but i mean you can write something like
[ 1385.00- 1390.00] MEE073: but i mean you can write something like
[ 1390.00- 1395.00] FEO070: we will try and do it on the fly and observe if that is going to take too long
[ 1390.00- 1395.00] FEO072: we will try and do it on the fly and observe if that is going to take too long

[ 1395.00- 1400.00] FEO070: if it is going to take too long well think about writing it to a file
[ 1395.00- 1400.00] FEO072: if it is going to take too long well think about writing it to a file
[ 1395.00- 1400.00] MEE071: if it is going to take too long well think about writing it to a file

[ 1400.00- 1405.00] FEO070: it should just be if statements right
[ 1400.00- 1405.00] FEO072: it should just be if statements right
[ 1400.00- 1405.00] MEE071: it should just be if statements right
[ 1400.00- 1405.00] MEE073: it should just be if statements right
[ 1410.00- 1414.52] FEO070: and flip it into just a transform zone
[ 1410.00- 1414.52] FEO072: and flip it into just a transform zone

[  489.00-  492.00] MEE073: good yeah
[  492.00-  495.00] FEO072: so each time are you going straight to the xml files for the information
[  492.00-  495.00] MEE071: so each time are you going straight to the xml files for the information
[  492.00-  495.00] MEE073: so each time are you going straight to the xml files for the information
[  495.00-  499.00] FEO072: no there is still an object file it processes a whole lot offline and stores it as an object
[  495.00-  499.00] MEE071: no there is still an object file it processes a whole lot offline and stores it as an object
[  495.00-  499.00] MEE073: no there is still an object file it processes a whole lot offline and stores it as an object
[  499.00-  500.00] FEO072: ok
[  499.00-  500.00] MEE071: ok
[  499.00-  500.00] MEE073: ok
[  500.00-  504.00] FEO072: and then they are much much smaller they are only like a one a file of 1k
[  500.00-  504.00] MEE071: and then they are much much smaller they are only like a one a file of 1k
[  500.00-  504.00] MEE073: and then they are much much smaller they are only like a one a file of 1k
[  504.00-  505.00] FEO072: so that is all just pre processed
[  504.00-  505.00] MEE071: so that is all just pre processed
[  504.00-  505.00] MEE073: so that is all just pre processed
[  505.00-  509.00] FEO072: yeah it is all pre processed and then it is just each month the object has got a return
[  505.00-  509.00] MEE071: yeah it is all pre processed and then it is just each month the object has got a return
[  505.00-  509.00] MEE073: yeah it is all pre processed and then it is just each month the object has got a return
[  510.00-  511.28] FEO072: you have to recreate the object
[  510.00-  511.28] MEE071: you have to recreate the object
[  510.00-  511.28] MEE073: you have to recreate the object
[  511.28-  513.12] FEO072: it is called a load method
[  511.28-  513.12] MEE071: it is called a load method
[  511.28-  513.12] MEE073: it is called a load method
[  513.12-  514.90] FEO072: so what you do is you call in all constructor
[  513.12-  514.90] MEE071: so what you do is you call in all constructor
[  513.12-  514.90] MEE073: so what you do is you call in all constructor
[  514.90-  517.80] FEO072: because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting
[  514.90-  517.80] MEE071: because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting
[  514.90-  517.80] MEE073: because if you call the proper constructor for each meeting
[  517.80-  519.12] FEO072: it goes off and does all the processing
[  517.80-  519.12] MEE071: it goes off and does all the processing
[  517.80-  519.12] MEE073: it goes off and does all the processing
[  519.12-  520.62] FEO072: and stores its own object
[  519.12-  520.62] MEE071: and stores its own object
[  519.12-  520.62] MEE073: and stores its own object
[  520.62-  523.64] FEO072: and then if you call in all constructor
[  520.62-  523.64] MEE071: and then if you call in all constructor
[  520.62-  523.64] MEE073: and then if you call in all constructor
[  523.64-  526.40] FEO072: then you call load and you can call load on the other one
[  523.64-  526.40] MEE071: then you call load and you can call load on the other one
[  523.64-  526.40] MEE073: then you call load and you can call load on the other one
[  526.40-  528.16] FEO072: or all of them or anything like that
[  526.40-  528.16] MEE071: or all of them or anything like that
[  526.40-  528.16] MEE073: or all of them or anything like that
[  528.16-  529.00] FEO072: there is a list
[  528.16-  529.00] MEE071: there is a list
[  528.16-  529.00] MEE073: there is a list
[  529.00-  531.20] FEO072: is it for the entire corpus
[  529.00-  531.20] MEE071: is it for the entire corpus
[  529.00-  531.20] MEE073: is it for the entire corpus
[  531.20-  532.40] FEO072: or is it just like individual ones
[  531.20-  532.40] MEE071: or is it just like individual ones
[  531.20-  532.40] MEE073: or is it just like individual ones
[  532.40-  535.48] FEO072: like one object for each meeting
[  532.40-  535.48] MEE071: like one object for each meeting
[  532.40-  535.48] MEE073: like one object for each meeting
[  535.48-  536.32] FEO072: oh each meeting

[  541.92-  542.92] MEE073: wow
[  542.92-  546.20] FEO072: yeah it just tells you who participated at the moment
[  542.92-  546.20] MEE071: yeah it just tells you who participated at the moment
[  542.92-  546.20] MEE073: yeah it just tells you who participated at the moment
[  546.20-  551.12] FEO072: it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time
[  546.20-  551.12] MEE071: it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time
[  546.20-  551.12] MEE073: it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time
[  551.12-  552.12] FEO072: as well
[  551.12-  552.12] MEE071: as well
[  551.12-  552.12] MEE073: as well
[  552.12-  555.12] FEO072: can you put in there what topic we are speaking about as well

[  552.12-  555.12] MEE073: can you put in there what topic we are speaking about as well
[  555.12-  556.12] FEO072: yeah yeah that would be easier
[  555.12-  556.12] MEE071: yeah yeah that would be easier
[  555.12-  556.12] MEE073: yeah yeah that would be easier
[  556.12-  559.12] FEO072: i could use that for the topic pop up window
[  556.12-  559.12] MEE071: i could use that for the topic pop up window
[  556.12-  559.12] MEE073: i could use that for the topic pop up window
[  559.12-  560.96] FEO072: yeah that would be too difficult
[  559.12-  560.96] MEE071: yeah that would be too difficult
[  559.12-  560.96] MEE073: yeah that would be too difficult
[  560.96-  564.92] FEO072: that would cause a problem with anything that was not annotated for topics
[  560.96-  564.92] MEE071: that would cause a problem with anything that was not annotated for topics
[  560.96-  564.92] MEE073: that would cause a problem with anything that was not annotated for topics
[  564.92-  566.20] FEO072: that was not what
[  564.92-  566.20] MEE071: that was not what
[  564.92-  566.20] MEE073: that was not what
[  566.20-  569.20] FEO072: or just return a null or a blank or a blank string
[  566.20-  569.20] MEE071: or just return a null or a blank or a blank string
[  566.20-  569.20] MEE073: or just return a null or a blank or a blank string
[  570.00-  577.00] FEO072: there are some default ones actually a lot of people do not give a great

[  570.00-  577.00] MEE073: there are some default ones actually a lot of people do not give a great
[  577.00-  587.00] FEO072: because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic
[  577.00-  587.00] MEE071: because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics you have the option of popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic

[  600.00-  603.80] MEE073: problem or what topics were involved so it does not crash the thing
[  603.80-  610.52] FEO072: so how would you calculate that would you do the summarisation as you populate it
[  603.80-  610.52] MEE071: so how would you calculate that would you do the summarisation as you populate it
[  603.80-  610.52] MEE073: so how would you calculate that would you do the summarisation as you populate it
[  610.52-  614.04] FEO072: the global statistics come straight off of that do not they because they are just for
[  610.52-  614.04] MEE071: the global statistics come straight off of that do not they because they are just for
[  610.52-  614.04] MEE073: the global statistics come straight off of that do not they because they are just for
[  614.04-  618.28] FEO072: the meat oh right so that is all stored together

[  614.04-  618.28] MEE073: the meat oh right so that is all stored together
[  618.28-  624.28] FEO072: the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that
[  618.28-  624.28] MEE071: the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that
[  618.28-  624.28] MEE073: the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that
[  624.28-  628.56] FEO072: stuff sounds good so have you done these yet
[  624.28-  628.56] MEE071: stuff sounds good so have you done these yet
[  624.28-  628.56] MEE073: stuff sounds good so have you done these yet
[  630.00-  637.00] FEO072: i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
[  630.00-  637.00] MEE071: i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
[  630.00-  637.00] MEE073: i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
[  637.00-  644.00] FEO072: so it is all usable now can i do it tonight
[  637.00-  644.00] MEE071: so it is all usable now can i do it tonight
[  637.00-  644.00] MEE073: so it is all usable now can i do it tonight
[  644.00-  649.80] FEO072: no design the game first the problem is if you change the classes the objects serial
[  644.00-  649.80] MEE071: no design the game first the problem is if you change the classes the objects serial
[  644.00-  649.80] MEE073: no design the game first the problem is if you change the classes the objects serial
[  649.80-  652.80] FEO072: numbers change and you can not reload the objects so all the processing has to be done over
[  649.80-  652.80] MEE071: numbers change and you can not reload the objects so all the processing has to be done over
[  649.80-  652.80] MEE073: numbers change and you can not reload the objects so all the processing has to be done over
[  652.80-  658.80] FEO072: again and i have not quite finished a bit so it would become out of sync and get a bit
[  652.80-  658.80] MEE071: again and i have not quite finished a bit so it would become out of sync and get a bit
[  652.80-  658.80] MEE073: again and i have not quite finished a bit so it would become out of sync and get a bit
[  660.00-  663.96] FEO072: you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it and then i changed it and
[  660.00-  663.96] MEE071: you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it and then i changed it and
[  660.00-  663.96] MEE073: you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it and then i changed it and
[  663.96-  666.64] FEO072: run the thing again you would never be able to load the objects back up
[  663.96-  666.64] MEE071: run the thing again you would never be able to load the objects back up
[  663.96-  666.64] MEE073: run the thing again you would never be able to load the objects back up

[ 1035.00- 1036.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1036.00- 1045.00] FEO072: with all the and that because it is the dialog class that you use there
[ 1036.00- 1045.00] MEE071: with all the and that because it is the dialog class that you use there
[ 1036.00- 1045.00] MEE073: with all the and that because it is the dialog class that you use there
[ 1045.00- 1048.00] FEO072: i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first
[ 1045.00- 1048.00] MEE071: i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first
[ 1045.00- 1048.00] MEE073: i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first
[ 1050.00- 1057.36] FEO072: yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
[ 1050.00- 1057.36] MEE071: yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
[ 1050.00- 1057.36] MEE073: yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
[ 1057.36- 1060.36] FEO072: and through that once you have got the results you click on something
[ 1057.36- 1060.36] MEE071: and through that once you have got the results you click on something
[ 1057.36- 1060.36] MEE073: and through that once you have got the results you click on something
[ 1060.36- 1065.36] FEO072: stupidnxt search would need you to have a meeting loaded before you start doing any searching
[ 1060.36- 1065.36] MEE071: stupidnxt search would need you to have a meeting loaded before you start doing any searching
[ 1060.36- 1065.36] MEE073: stupidnxt search would need you to have a meeting loaded before you start doing any searching
[ 1065.36- 1067.36] FEO072: well we can put the logic in it
[ 1065.36- 1067.36] MEE071: well we can put the logic in it
[ 1065.36- 1067.36] MEE073: well we can put the logic in it
[ 1067.36- 1072.36] FEO072: the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you have loaded an observation
[ 1067.36- 1072.36] MEE071: the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you have loaded an observation
[ 1067.36- 1072.36] MEE073: the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you have loaded an observation
[ 1072.36- 1076.36] FEO072: i think you probably even that should not be too hard to put a check in there
[ 1072.36- 1076.36] MEE071: i think you probably even that should not be too hard to put a check in there
[ 1072.36- 1076.36] MEE073: i think you probably even that should not be too hard to put a check in there
[ 1076.36- 1078.36] FEO072: and if it has not loaded then force it to load it
[ 1076.36- 1078.36] MEE071: and if it has not loaded then force it to load it
[ 1076.36- 1078.36] MEE073: and if it has not loaded then force it to load it
[ 1080.00- 1084.76] FEO072: does not that we could you could use the inverted file search to return a list of
[ 1080.00- 1084.76] MEE071: does not that we could you could use the inverted file search to return a list of
[ 1080.00- 1084.76] MEE073: does not that we could you could use the inverted file search to return a list of
[ 1084.76- 1091.32] FEO072: meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you will not can you not
[ 1084.76- 1091.32] MEE071: meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you will not can you not
[ 1084.76- 1091.32] MEE073: meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you will not can you not
[ 1091.32- 1095.98] FEO072: get this normal object it has to be an observation and even if you go you can
[ 1091.32- 1095.98] MEE071: get this normal object it has to be an observation and even if you go you can
[ 1091.32- 1095.98] MEE073: get this normal object it has to be an observation and even if you go you can
[ 1095.98- 1099.32] FEO072: go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start
[ 1095.98- 1099.32] MEE071: go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start
[ 1095.98- 1099.32] MEE073: go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start
[ 1099.32- 1103.16] FEO072: with something for some bizarre reason the engine there is only one there is only
[ 1099.32- 1103.16] MEE071: with something for some bizarre reason the engine there is only one there is only
[ 1099.32- 1103.16] MEE073: with something for some bizarre reason the engine there is only one there is only
[ 1103.16- 1108.76] FEO072: one search method to the search engine the engine class
[ 1103.16- 1108.76] MEE071: one search method to the search engine the engine class
[ 1103.16- 1108.76] MEE073: one search method to the search engine the engine class
[ 1110.00- 1112.44] FEO072: yeah we would not want to use nxt at the beginning anyway
[ 1110.00- 1112.44] MEE071: yeah we would not want to use nxt at the beginning anyway
[ 1110.00- 1112.44] MEE073: yeah we would not want to use nxt at the beginning anyway
[ 1112.44- 1114.56] FEO072: because we do not want to search locally
[ 1112.44- 1114.56] MEE071: because we do not want to search locally
[ 1112.44- 1114.56] MEE073: because we do not want to search locally
[ 1114.56- 1115.96] FEO072: we want to search globally
[ 1114.56- 1115.96] MEE071: we want to search globally
[ 1114.56- 1115.96] MEE073: we want to search globally
[ 1115.96- 1117.60] FEO072: so let us say
[ 1115.96- 1117.60] MEE071: so let us say
[ 1115.96- 1117.60] MEE073: so let us say
[ 1117.60- 1120.36] FEO072: unless they know what meeting it is
[ 1117.60- 1120.36] MEE071: unless they know what meeting it is
[ 1117.60- 1120.36] MEE073: unless they know what meeting it is
[ 1120.36- 1122.76] FEO072: one note then they would open meeting first right
[ 1120.36- 1122.76] MEE071: one note then they would open meeting first right
[ 1120.36- 1122.76] MEE073: one note then they would open meeting first right
[ 1122.76- 1123.88] FEO072: yeah
[ 1122.76- 1123.88] MEE071: yeah
[ 1122.76- 1123.88] MEE073: yeah
[ 1123.88- 1125.36] FEO072: so let us say they have two options
[ 1123.88- 1125.36] MEE071: so let us say they have two options
[ 1123.88- 1125.36] MEE073: so let us say they have two options
[ 1125.36- 1128.32] FEO072: either pick one meeting or search globally
[ 1125.36- 1128.32] MEE071: either pick one meeting or search globally
[ 1125.36- 1128.32] MEE073: either pick one meeting or search globally
[ 1128.32- 1131.20] FEO072: to find a meeting that they are interested in
[ 1128.32- 1131.20] MEE071: to find a meeting that they are interested in
[ 1128.32- 1131.20] MEE073: to find a meeting that they are interested in
[ 1131.20- 1131.70] FEO072: yeah
[ 1131.20- 1131.70] MEE071: yeah
[ 1131.20- 1131.70] MEE073: yeah
[ 1135.48- 1138.24] FEO072: or well the things that may just be looking for a word
[ 1135.48- 1138.24] MEE071: or well the things that may just be looking for a word
[ 1135.48- 1138.24] MEE073: or well the things that may just be looking for a word
[ 1140.00- 1143.00] FEO072: different meetings then at that point they will probably want to
[ 1140.00- 1143.00] MEE071: different meetings then at that point they will probably want to
[ 1140.00- 1143.00] MEE073: different meetings then at that point they will probably want to
[ 1143.00- 1147.00] FEO072: like do we want to like if it dot by default goes with the first one and they want number five
[ 1143.00- 1147.00] MEE071: like do we want to like if it dot by default goes with the first one and they want number five
[ 1143.00- 1147.00] MEE073: like do we want to like if it dot by default goes with the first one and they want number five
[ 1147.00- 1150.00] FEO072: of the ones that are returned do we need to go through
[ 1147.00- 1150.00] MEE071: of the ones that are returned do we need to go through
[ 1147.00- 1150.00] MEE073: of the ones that are returned do we need to go through
[ 1150.00- 1152.00] FEO072: but why do we want default i mean just
[ 1150.00- 1152.00] MEE071: but why do we want default i mean just
[ 1150.00- 1152.00] MEE073: but why do we want default i mean just
[ 1152.00- 1155.00] FEO072: well like to load up like the thing is i think
[ 1152.00- 1155.00] MEE071: well like to load up like the thing is i think
[ 1152.00- 1155.00] MEE073: well like to load up like the thing is i think
[ 1155.00- 1160.00] FEO072: like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and whatever the window
[ 1155.00- 1160.00] MEE071: like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and whatever the window
[ 1155.00- 1160.00] MEE073: like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and whatever the window
[ 1160.00- 1163.00] FEO072: right now i think just the topic ones
[ 1160.00- 1163.00] MEE071: right now i think just the topic ones
[ 1160.00- 1163.00] MEE073: right now i think just the topic ones
[ 1163.00- 1169.00] FEO072: although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data so
[ 1163.00- 1169.00] MEE071: although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data so
[ 1163.00- 1169.00] MEE073: although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data so
[ 1170.00- 1172.08] FEO072: thinking if it is kind of like you were saying
[ 1170.00- 1172.08] MEE071: thinking if it is kind of like you were saying
[ 1170.00- 1172.08] MEE073: thinking if it is kind of like you were saying
[ 1172.08- 1174.68] FEO072: you have to have a norm object right
[ 1172.08- 1174.68] MEE071: you have to have a norm object right
[ 1172.08- 1174.68] MEE073: you have to have a norm object right
[ 1174.68- 1176.32] FEO072: i mean what do you do
[ 1174.68- 1176.32] MEE071: i mean what do you do
[ 1174.68- 1176.32] MEE073: i mean what do you do
[ 1176.32- 1177.20] FEO072: you search it all
[ 1176.32- 1177.20] MEE071: you search it all
[ 1176.32- 1177.20] MEE073: you search it all
[ 1177.20- 1178.48] FEO072: yeah but local search
[ 1177.20- 1178.48] MEE071: yeah but local search
[ 1177.20- 1178.48] MEE073: yeah but local search
[ 1178.48- 1179.30] FEO072: yeah
[ 1178.48- 1179.30] MEE071: yeah
[ 1178.48- 1179.30] MEE073: yeah
[ 1179.30- 1180.14] FEO072: we can do global search right
[ 1179.30- 1180.14] MEE071: we can do global search right
[ 1179.30- 1180.14] MEE073: we can do global search right
[ 1180.14- 1181.44] FEO072: that is true
[ 1180.14- 1181.44] MEE071: that is true
[ 1180.14- 1181.44] MEE073: that is true
[ 1181.44- 1183.16] FEO072: it does not take long to load up anyway
[ 1181.44- 1183.16] MEE071: it does not take long to load up anyway
[ 1181.44- 1183.16] MEE073: it does not take long to load up anyway
[ 1183.16- 1184.72] FEO072: you can load a dumb one up it does not have any
[ 1183.16- 1184.72] MEE071: you can load a dumb one up it does not have any
[ 1183.16- 1184.72] MEE073: you can load a dumb one up it does not have any
[ 1184.72- 1188.04] FEO072: yeah but the ok the global one feeds into the local
[ 1184.72- 1188.04] MEE071: yeah but the ok the global one feeds into the local
[ 1184.72- 1188.04] MEE073: yeah but the ok the global one feeds into the local
[ 1189.08- 1189.92] FEO072: yeah
[ 1189.08- 1189.92] MEE071: yeah
[ 1189.08- 1189.92] MEE073: yeah
[ 1189.92- 1191.24] FEO072: so if we are getting any usable data
[ 1189.92- 1191.24] MEE071: so if we are getting any usable data
[ 1189.92- 1191.24] MEE073: so if we are getting any usable data
[ 1191.24- 1193.24] FEO072: it is going to be doing a search on each of those files
[ 1191.24- 1193.24] MEE071: it is going to be doing a search on each of those files
[ 1191.24- 1193.24] MEE073: it is going to be doing a search on each of those files
[ 1193.24- 1200.00] FEO072: so it is
[ 1193.24- 1200.00] MEE071: so it is
[ 1193.24- 1200.00] MEE073: so it is
[ 1200.00- 1204.72] FEO072: gives the non objects basically to the local search
[ 1200.00- 1204.72] MEE071: gives the non objects basically to the local search
[ 1200.00- 1204.72] MEE073: gives the non objects basically to the local search
[ 1204.72- 1207.76] FEO072: but it could be time consuming if there are ten documents that
[ 1204.72- 1207.76] MEE071: but it could be time consuming if there are ten documents that
[ 1204.72- 1207.76] MEE073: but it could be time consuming if there are ten documents that
[ 1207.76- 1208.24] FEO072: have it listed
[ 1207.76- 1208.24] MEE071: have it listed
[ 1207.76- 1208.24] MEE073: have it listed
[ 1208.24- 1211.00] FEO072: that is always going to be the case with search
[ 1208.24- 1211.00] MEE071: that is always going to be the case with search
[ 1208.24- 1211.00] MEE073: that is always going to be the case with search
[ 1211.00- 1212.88] FEO072: but it gives one at a time anyway does not it
[ 1211.00- 1212.88] MEE071: but it gives one at a time anyway does not it
[ 1211.00- 1212.88] MEE073: but it gives one at a time anyway does not it
[ 1212.88- 1214.84] FEO072: because otherwise you crash the thing
[ 1212.88- 1214.84] MEE071: because otherwise you crash the thing
[ 1212.88- 1214.84] MEE073: because otherwise you crash the thing
[ 1214.84- 1216.72] FEO072: yeah well just thinking of some way
[ 1214.84- 1216.72] MEE071: yeah well just thinking of some way
[ 1214.84- 1216.72] MEE073: yeah well just thinking of some way
[ 1216.72- 1220.24] FEO072: we could catch the results in a nice little format
[ 1216.72- 1220.24] MEE071: we could catch the results in a nice little format
[ 1216.72- 1220.24] MEE073: we could catch the results in a nice little format
[ 1220.24- 1222.96] FEO072: that will make things a bit easier
[ 1220.24- 1222.96] MEE071: that will make things a bit easier
[ 1220.24- 1222.96] MEE073: that will make things a bit easier
[ 1222.96- 1224.38] FEO072: but the thing is if we have got that
[ 1222.96- 1224.38] MEE071: but the thing is if we have got that
[ 1222.96- 1224.38] MEE073: but the thing is if we have got that
[ 1224.38- 1226.76] FEO072: then it is going to be needing really
[ 1224.38- 1226.76] MEE071: then it is going to be needing really
[ 1224.38- 1226.76] MEE073: then it is going to be needing really
[ 1230.00- 1232.64] FEO072: if it is trying to show us where those were
[ 1230.00- 1232.64] MEE071: if it is trying to show us where those were
[ 1230.00- 1232.64] MEE073: if it is trying to show us where those were
[ 1232.64- 1235.12] FEO072: trying to highlight those in the text transcript whatever
[ 1232.64- 1235.12] MEE071: trying to highlight those in the text transcript whatever
[ 1232.64- 1235.12] MEE073: trying to highlight those in the text transcript whatever
[ 1235.12- 1237.44] FEO072: then we are going to have to have all that other data in there
[ 1235.12- 1237.44] MEE071: then we are going to have to have all that other data in there
[ 1235.12- 1237.44] MEE073: then we are going to have to have all that other data in there
[ 1237.44- 1239.36] FEO072: so each time we leave the search window
[ 1237.44- 1239.36] MEE071: so each time we leave the search window
[ 1237.44- 1239.36] MEE073: so each time we leave the search window
[ 1239.36- 1241.44] FEO072: and we have ten different meetings
[ 1239.36- 1241.44] MEE071: and we have ten different meetings
[ 1239.36- 1241.44] MEE073: and we have ten different meetings
[ 1241.44- 1243.68] FEO072: the word wireless comes up go to meeting one
[ 1241.44- 1243.68] MEE071: the word wireless comes up go to meeting one
[ 1241.44- 1243.68] MEE073: the word wireless comes up go to meeting one
[ 1243.68- 1246.64] FEO072: it has to reload the normal object
[ 1243.68- 1246.64] MEE071: it has to reload the normal object
[ 1243.68- 1246.64] MEE073: it has to reload the normal object
[ 1246.64- 1247.92] FEO072: next one
[ 1246.64- 1247.92] MEE071: next one
[ 1246.64- 1247.92] MEE073: next one
[ 1247.92- 1249.84] FEO072: i mean that is kind of like a kitty
[ 1247.92- 1249.84] MEE071: i mean that is kind of like a kitty
[ 1247.92- 1249.84] MEE073: i mean that is kind of like a kitty
[ 1249.84- 1251.44] FEO072: yeah it is not too slow though i think
[ 1249.84- 1251.44] MEE071: yeah it is not too slow though i think
[ 1249.84- 1251.44] MEE073: yeah it is not too slow though i think
[ 1251.44- 1252.96] FEO072: it is not too bad on that
[ 1251.44- 1252.96] MEE071: it is not too bad on that
[ 1251.44- 1252.96] MEE073: it is not too bad on that
[ 1252.96- 1255.12] FEO072: i do not think that will be a ten odd second problem
[ 1252.96- 1255.12] MEE071: i do not think that will be a ten odd second problem
[ 1252.96- 1255.12] MEE073: i do not think that will be a ten odd second problem
[ 1255.12- 1260.00] FEO072: it always
[ 1255.12- 1260.00] MEE071: it always
[ 1255.12- 1260.00] MEE073: it always
[ 1260.00- 1264.00] FEO072: loading it up test it try some other things shut down load it up
[ 1260.00- 1264.00] MEE071: loading it up test it try some other things shut down load it up
[ 1260.00- 1264.00] MEE073: loading it up test it try some other things shut down load it up
[ 1264.00- 1268.00] FEO072: so just sort of based on that
[ 1264.00- 1268.00] MEE071: so just sort of based on that
[ 1264.00- 1268.00] MEE073: so just sort of based on that
[ 1268.00- 1275.00] FEO072: but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
[ 1268.00- 1275.00] MEE071: but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
[ 1268.00- 1275.00] MEE073: but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
[ 1275.00- 1279.00] FEO072: i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that
[ 1275.00- 1279.00] MEE071: i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that
[ 1275.00- 1279.00] MEE073: i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that
[ 1279.00- 1285.00] FEO072: if you do a global search the first step only returns the meetings
[ 1279.00- 1285.00] MEE071: if you do a global search the first step only returns the meetings
[ 1279.00- 1285.00] MEE073: if you do a global search the first step only returns the meetings
[ 1285.00- 1288.00] FEO072: as in not even the meetings but the name of the meetings
[ 1285.00- 1288.00] MEE071: as in not even the meetings but the name of the meetings
[ 1285.00- 1288.00] MEE073: as in not even the meetings but the name of the meetings
[ 1290.00- 1294.96] FEO072: search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the meetings
[ 1290.00- 1294.96] MEE071: search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the meetings
[ 1290.00- 1294.96] MEE073: search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the meetings
[ 1294.96- 1298.52] FEO072: that contain the word language and then you can decide well i want to search on
[ 1294.96- 1298.52] MEE071: that contain the word language and then you can decide well i want to search on
[ 1294.96- 1298.52] MEE073: that contain the word language and then you can decide well i want to search on
[ 1298.52- 1301.96] FEO072: this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting
[ 1298.52- 1301.96] MEE071: this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting
[ 1298.52- 1301.96] MEE073: this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting
[ 1301.96- 1308.96] FEO072: yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return of things when they actually need to search
[ 1301.96- 1308.96] MEE071: yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return of things when they actually need to search
[ 1301.96- 1308.96] MEE073: yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return of things when they actually need to search
[ 1308.96- 1312.96] FEO072: that makes sense and that way they know specifically which meeting it is
[ 1308.96- 1312.96] MEE071: that makes sense and that way they know specifically which meeting it is
[ 1308.96- 1312.96] MEE073: that makes sense and that way they know specifically which meeting it is
[ 1312.96- 1318.96] FEO072: because i am sure they do not want to have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it

[ 1538.56- 1541.84] MEE071: topic but actually they are touching keywords
[ 1538.56- 1541.84] MEE073: topic but actually they are touching keywords
[ 1541.84- 1543.84] FEO072: which is a good idea
[ 1541.84- 1543.84] MEE071: which is a good idea
[ 1541.84- 1543.84] MEE073: which is a good idea
[ 1548.24- 1550.24] FEO072: you get that on the way that would be really nice
[ 1548.24- 1550.24] MEE071: you get that on the way that would be really nice
[ 1548.24- 1550.24] MEE073: you get that on the way that would be really nice
[ 1560.00- 1567.60] FEO072: the easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies

[ 1560.00- 1567.60] MEE073: the easy bit is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole currencies
[ 1567.60- 1573.36] FEO072: in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic because you do not have to integrate
[ 1567.60- 1573.36] MEE071: in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic because you do not have to integrate
[ 1567.60- 1573.36] MEE073: in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic because you do not have to integrate
[ 1573.36- 1574.36] FEO072: as much

[ 1574.36- 1575.36] MEE073: yeah definitely
[ 1575.36- 1582.36] FEO072: no you can do search without tf idf
[ 1575.36- 1582.36] MEE071: no you can do search without tf idf
[ 1575.36- 1582.36] MEE073: no you can do search without tf idf
[ 1582.36- 1583.36] FEO072: you just can not write the search
[ 1582.36- 1583.36] MEE071: you just can not write the search
[ 1582.36- 1583.36] MEE073: you just can not write the search
[ 1583.36- 1584.36] FEO072: yeah that is what i am thinking too
[ 1583.36- 1584.36] MEE071: yeah that is what i am thinking too
[ 1583.36- 1584.36] MEE073: yeah that is what i am thinking too
[ 1584.36- 1585.36] FEO072: do we need to
[ 1584.36- 1585.36] MEE071: do we need to
[ 1584.36- 1585.36] MEE073: do we need to
[ 1585.36- 1586.36] FEO072: i mean we are just looking for you stuff i guess

[ 1586.36- 1590.00] MEE073: no no
[ 1590.00- 1594.00] FEO072: no no but is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank the results
[ 1590.00- 1594.00] MEE071: no no but is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank the results
[ 1590.00- 1594.00] MEE073: no no but is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank the results
[ 1594.00- 1599.00] FEO072: sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed it up speed the search up because
[ 1594.00- 1599.00] MEE071: sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed it up speed the search up because
[ 1594.00- 1599.00] MEE073: sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed it up speed the search up because
[ 1599.00- 1603.00] FEO072: nxt was over the top the whole of the corpus was just not feasible
[ 1599.00- 1603.00] MEE071: nxt was over the top the whole of the corpus was just not feasible
[ 1599.00- 1603.00] MEE073: nxt was over the top the whole of the corpus was just not feasible
[ 1603.00- 1607.00] FEO072: yeah but that went slow down ranking went slow down
[ 1603.00- 1607.00] MEE071: yeah but that went slow down ranking went slow down
[ 1603.00- 1607.00] MEE073: yeah but that went slow down ranking went slow down
[ 1607.00- 1610.00] FEO072: no but the general inverted file
[ 1607.00- 1610.00] MEE071: no but the general inverted file
[ 1607.00- 1610.00] MEE073: no but the general inverted file
[ 1610.00- 1614.00] FEO072: yeah it still uses an inverted file but it ranks the results by the amount of

[ 1726.04- 1736.28] MEE073: closer and do that the nxt search yeah i guess just do some of the of the
[ 1740.00- 1744.96] FEO072: and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score and the higher the more

[ 1770.00- 1775.12] FEO072: sort of like if the nxt search is still got to be run to find these terms or these groups
[ 1770.00- 1775.12] MEE071: sort of like if the nxt search is still got to be run to find these terms or these groups

[ 1787.00- 1792.00] MEE073: in like the other windows like the various like different topic
[ 1792.00- 1798.00] FEO070: usually one left click it is highlights it cross highlights everything i think
[ 1792.00- 1798.00] FEO072: usually one left click it is highlights it cross highlights everything i think
[ 1792.00- 1798.00] MEE071: usually one left click it is highlights it cross highlights everything i think

[ 1800.00- 1804.28] MEE073: particular window that you want me to mimic its behavior
[ 1804.28- 1806.24] FEO070: then just find it in the program and just say
[ 1804.28- 1806.24] FEO072: then just find it in the program and just say
[ 1804.28- 1806.24] MEE071: then just find it in the program and just say
[ 1804.28- 1806.24] MEE073: then just find it in the program and just say
[ 1806.24- 1808.32] FEO070: ok just how this one does it
[ 1806.24- 1808.32] FEO072: ok just how this one does it
[ 1806.24- 1808.32] MEE071: ok just how this one does it
[ 1806.24- 1808.32] MEE073: ok just how this one does it
[ 1808.32- 1810.64] FEO070: so if it is like the topic window or whatever
[ 1808.32- 1810.64] FEO072: so if it is like the topic window or whatever
[ 1808.32- 1810.64] MEE071: so if it is like the topic window or whatever
[ 1808.32- 1810.64] MEE073: so if it is like the topic window or whatever
[ 1810.64- 1812.20] FEO070: well it is difficult because
[ 1810.64- 1812.20] FEO072: well it is difficult because
[ 1810.64- 1812.20] MEE071: well it is difficult because
[ 1810.64- 1812.20] MEE073: well it is difficult because
[ 1816.68- 1818.44] FEO070: so i can just trace back and figure out
[ 1816.68- 1818.44] FEO072: so i can just trace back and figure out
[ 1816.68- 1818.44] MEE071: so i can just trace back and figure out
[ 1816.68- 1818.44] MEE073: so i can just trace back and figure out
[ 1818.44- 1822.24] FEO070: what objects they are bringing into you
[ 1818.44- 1822.24] FEO072: what objects they are bringing into you

[ 1818.44- 1822.24] MEE073: what objects they are bringing into you
[ 1823.76- 1825.40] FEO070: no it is difficult
[ 1823.76- 1825.40] FEO072: no it is difficult
[ 1823.76- 1825.40] MEE071: no it is difficult
[ 1823.76- 1825.40] MEE073: no it is difficult
[ 1825.40- 1828.20] FEO070: because the transcription window does cross highlighting
[ 1825.40- 1828.20] FEO072: because the transcription window does cross highlighting
[ 1825.40- 1828.20] MEE071: because the transcription window does cross highlighting
[ 1825.40- 1828.20] MEE073: because the transcription window does cross highlighting
[ 1830.00- 1835.00] FEO070: because it has to find the topic first that was a pain
[ 1830.00- 1835.00] FEO072: because it has to find the topic first that was a pain
[ 1830.00- 1835.00] MEE071: because it has to find the topic first that was a pain
[ 1830.00- 1835.00] MEE073: because it has to find the topic first that was a pain
[ 1835.00- 1846.00] FEO070: and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic
[ 1835.00- 1846.00] FEO072: and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic
[ 1835.00- 1846.00] MEE071: and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that topic

[ 1846.00- 1854.00] FEO070: and that works when you left double click on a meeting then it loads it
[ 1846.00- 1854.00] FEO072: and that works when you left double click on a meeting then it loads it
[ 1846.00- 1854.00] MEE071: and that works when you left double click on a meeting then it loads it
[ 1846.00- 1854.00] MEE073: and that works when you left double click on a meeting then it loads it
[ 1854.00- 1858.00] FEO070: so you could take that for loading
[ 1854.00- 1858.00] FEO072: so you could take that for loading
[ 1854.00- 1858.00] MEE071: so you could take that for loading
[ 1854.00- 1858.00] MEE073: so you could take that for loading
[ 1860.00- 1864.72] FEO070: have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click that
[ 1860.00- 1864.72] FEO072: have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click that
