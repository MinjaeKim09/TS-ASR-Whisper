[    0.36-    1.74] MEE071: funkish
[    0.96-    6.84] MEE073: i wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings
[    3.58-    5.38] FEO072: yeah exactly
[    3.76-   12.12] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah welcome to start ok
[    8.60-    8.96] FEO070: ok
[   12.32-   15.22] FEO070: so what do we need to talk about it
[   13.20-   13.66] FEO072: shall we
[   14.98-   15.48] MEE071: has anybody
[   15.20-   25.22] FEO072: well shall we just go round and everyone says what they have what they have been doing because i am sorry about it
[   19.08-   23.68] MEE071: has anybody thought anything
[   21.48-   23.28] MEE073: not more no
[   25.50-   29.76] MEE073: ok sounds like you have done something
[   25.76-   26.16] FEO070: yeah
[   28.44-   29.90] MEE071: yeah
[   30.00-   34.40] FEO072: ok well i have got a browser now which whoops already gone
[   30.50-   30.64] FEO070: alright
[   32.52-   32.72] FEO070: yeah
[   32.56-   32.72] MEE073: whoops
[   35.48-   45.50] FEO070: good start oh i dropped mine as well it is it is not a good story
[   41.78-   43.42] MEE071: give it this
[   43.96-   44.12] FEO072: yeah
[   48.28-   50.06] FEO070: ok so yeah
[   48.72-   49.02] FEO072: ok
[   50.38-   60.00] FEO072: so yeah we have got a browser with which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics and then when you go
[   60.00-   66.80] FEO072: are on the menu you can select a summarization box which pops up and an audio player
[   68.24-   68.56] MEE071: right
[   68.80-   84.76] FEO072: and that is i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search and it loads up just the background windows are empty and so when you start you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that
[   86.48-   87.08] FEO072: do that make sense
[   90.00-  103.92] FEO072: the transcription box has got a summarized bu button which does not do anything yet now i wonder how we want to do you know we want a pop up window with the speaker characterization
[  106.20-  120.00] FEO072: either we could do that you know when does a pop up come either we can when you click on the the i d any sort of i d in the transcription box or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarized
[  106.40-  106.60] MEE071: yeah
[  106.68-  106.88] MEE073: yeah
[  120.00-  134.80] FEO072: button so that you actually in the transcription box but so that you click on a button and then it opens whatever that speaker characterization is the problem is the the left click is already used because it highlights that
[  136.62-  150.00] FEO072: that part of speech or whatever that what he is going to say you know the left click highlights it so that you can i do not know what happens when you double click actually but that would be a bit annoying if you have left click for one to
[  138.78-  140.56] MEE071: the the left click or the left click
[  140.88-  141.12] FEO070: yeah
[  142.16-  142.52] MEE071: what
[  142.58-  144.00] FEO070: ok use double click or
[  150.00-  160.74] FEO072: and double click or something else i think so yeah when you left click it you can for example set set the marker there so that the the audio goes from there i think
[  162.68-  168.76] FEO072: so we can not put it on left click we could put it on a right click we could for example have a little menu that pops up
[  169.44-  170.92] MEE071: yeah it might be quite good that is right
[  170.64-  176.68] FEO072: so right click on a menu you know and you can click on speaker characterisation it pops in there
[  176.92-  179.68] MEE071: what else could we have in the menu
[  180.36-  183.64] FEO072: that is a good point i do not know
[  182.42-  186.96] MEE071: yeah otherwise you just have a right click or do
[  183.16-  185.98] MEE073: otherwise you just put the right click all day
[  185.12-  197.88] FEO072: yeah yeah but i do not know about you but usually in windows you right click does not do anything there is a it opens a menu yeah so yeah so but that would be yeah we could just yeah
[  186.02-  186.42] FEO070: yeah
[  190.08-  190.64] MEE071: is it window
[  192.32-  198.04] MEE071: a menu yeah yeah that is something we are doing i said it would might be a bit weird for it to just start bringing up stuff would not it
[  193.00-  193.36] FEO070: right
[  194.84-  202.60] MEE073: yeah yeah to just have the sort of same sort of idiom throughout kind of so
[  202.12-  202.48] FEO072: yeah
[  203.24-  203.56] MEE071: yeah
[  204.64-  206.60] FEO072: or just you know or just a button
[  207.60-  207.80] MEE073: yeah
[  207.74-  210.00] FEO070: i guess a button button makes a bit
[  210.00-  220.56] FEO070: more sense cause otherwise you do not really know that oh what if i right click now what happens then is that i can yeah
[  218.28-  221.54] FEO072: well no no you still have the menu yeah the menu pop up that
[  218.40-  218.70] MEE073: yeah
[  219.00-  221.30] MEE071: yeah it is more
[  223.04-  231.24] FEO072: well oh yeah it is more obvious is not it what what you can do yeah yeah that is true yeah it is more intuitive
[  224.94-  225.52] FEO070: right
[  225.08-  232.04] MEE071: it is more idiot proof is not it it has got a button but well
[  228.18-  228.90] FEO070: yeah
[  228.66-  240.00] MEE073: yeah but then it is not as expensive like if you want to add more things in the future then we have no new buttons i do not know where is the menu that thing is more flexible and more but probably not could be on the top
[  231.20-  233.08] FEO070: but well
[  234.62-  235.40] MEE071: i have no words of it
[  235.54-  236.76] FEO072: maybe maybe
[  238.90-  240.00] MEE071: yeah well in it
[  240.00-  251.96] MEE071: i guess in in in meeting browser one point one you can have a menu instead of a button but this one yeah
[  240.00-  240.42] MEE073: yeah
[  248.74-  260.08] FEO072: but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in
[  261.36-  266.64] FEO072: like a search for that user is that going to be useful or too much or
[  263.40-  263.80] MEE071: yeah
[  267.62-  270.00] MEE071: i guess so so what are you part of the m the menu
[  270.00-  272.90] MEE071: it comes down it says give me all your meetings i think
[  272.72-  279.08] FEO072: yeah so when you right click on it one one option will be gimme away meetings characterize the speaker
[  280.12-  280.54] MEE071: yep
[  284.08-  285.28] FEO072: or is that too much i mean
[  285.12-  290.28] FEO070: i do not know i mean it is more like part of the
[  286.06-  288.84] MEE071: i guess so it is a good idea yeah you might be
[  291.76-  300.00] FEO070: browsing sort of thing more than the speaker characterization as steve mentioned i do not really know how to give
[  296.86-  299.48] FEO072: yeah yeah that is true yeah yeah
[  298.68-  299.80] MEE073: yeah
[  300.00-  302.42] FEO070: of all the speaker character is in the background
[  301.00-  303.64] FEO072: yeah that is true it would be nice to have it in connect interconnected
[  301.44-  302.30] MEE073: yeah
[  303.36-  319.48] MEE073: yeah like maybe tie it in with dialog acts or something as well i mean speaker characterization tied into i dunno t just some way to sort of leverage that information like we have it we are doing it but what how does it help the browsing or what can it give us in the browser yeah yeah
[  316.60-  319.76] FEO072: well you mean the the speaker characterization oh well yeah i mean
[  321.38-  330.00] FEO072: i do not know about that i mean it is the speaker characterization is a bit like you said i mean it is like a nice thing we do not we are not actually sure what the user wants with it but
[  325.96-  326.16] MEE073: yeah
[  330.00-  332.36] FEO072: is interesting so why not give it to him
[  332.74-  333.20] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  334.08-  335.52] FEO072: i i think we should do it i mean
[  335.38-  356.32] FEO070: yeah i mean c i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like well if you get speak characterization that someone s talks a lot in a certain topic and then if you i dunno click on that topic you get everything that is in that topic or whatever and you have to expect that
[  354.76-  360.00] FEO072: yeah i mean that is that is still another level further i mean we are not in there here you know it is not it does not mean probably
[  358.84-  359.82] FEO070: no no no no i am just
[  359.54-  359.86] MEE071: yeah
[  360.00-  364.20] FEO072: of the speaker characterization yet y you have to first define what what happens when you click on a user
[  364.44-  370.32] MEE071: with the speaker characterization first before we crossing over the other side of the screen
[  366.96-  371.92] FEO072: yeah yes so shall we try try to do a right click menu then
[  367.40-  369.14] MEE073: yeah
[  374.72-  376.28] MEE071: yeah alright why not
[  376.28-  376.44] FEO070: ok
[  376.28-  387.86] MEE073: is that just from the main is that is that from any particular window like if we want to sorta get like if we are on the users versus like a topic or something have a right click for for these various things or
[  377.92-  378.14] FEO072: sorry
[  378.12-  379.40] MEE071: even if there is one thing coming in
[  385.70-  390.00] FEO072: yeah yes wait yeah there is a second thing about the topics
[  390.00-  404.88] FEO072: the topic window you want to somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that yeah so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well and it has a different menu for it
[  397.68-  399.22] MEE073: right yep yep
[  400.00-  404.88] MEE071: ok so so this lot is for
[  402.28-  403.04] MEE073: ok yeah
[  404.26-  406.72] MEE073: that is consistent throughout so ok
[  406.16-  406.48] FEO072: yeah
[  406.92-  408.08] MEE071: on the speaker
[  409.64-  420.00] FEO072: so yeah so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual
[  410.32-  411.80] MEE071: and then this lot is on the
[  420.00-  424.12] FEO072: observations and when then we have the interlinking by right click basically
[  424.58-  424.80] MEE073: right
[  426.12-  450.00] MEE073: actually yeah like another common thing like if we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu i mean that is kind of a typical kinda action that would happen if you double click on a particular topic or something that it goes to sort of a like a default view so it will be like all the cases of that topic either whatever we decide the default to be whether it is in all meetings or just in one meeting and just show up the the particular
[  435.40-  435.96] FEO072: double click
[  440.70-  441.12] FEO072: oh
[  450.00-  462.72] MEE073: the instances of that topic in the media like i am just thinking to have the default there so if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that is the most common thing that is going to happen so the double click will not do that and so save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
[  459.08-  459.92] FEO072: yeah
[  462.80-  466.94] FEO072: i do not see there is anything obvious that w that would be able to that would be
[  462.90-  463.26] FEO070: yeah
[  466.04-  469.32] MEE073: well it might come to us and start playing with it
[  469.40-  469.72] FEO070: yeah
[  469.52-  471.60] MEE071: what was that i think i understand do you mean
[  471.44-  480.00] MEE073: like we have the the right click menu you do not have the menu right clicking but instead of like have a default double click so if there is so it will be a choice for the name
[  471.86-  472.56] FEO070: disp
[  473.68-  474.12] MEE071: yeah
[  478.20-  480.00] MEE071: oh sorry and it could be example
[  478.66-  478.94] FEO070: yeah
[  480.00-  484.06] MEE071: what is the most common used double click ok
[  480.00-  482.76] MEE073: your call yeah exactly yeah
[  481.62-  481.86] FEO070: yeah
[  483.70-  487.84] FEO070: like i dunno show the speaker characterization for instance or just
[  486.08-  486.38] MEE073: yeah
[  486.36-  493.84] FEO072: yeah but then then there is a problem with a lot of windows popping up again and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know
[  486.56-  486.92] MEE071: yes
[  494.70-  497.20] MEE073: yeah yeah
[  496.26-  502.04] FEO070: but if you do double click on something do not you expect something to happen then
[  502.78-  504.50] FEO072: yeah maybe just have a
[  503.48-  505.18] FEO070: well
[  504.56-  509.88] MEE071: sometimes i do it right so that way you go like i will go away it is still coming up yeah
[  506.86-  510.00] MEE073: yeah i will do it closer yeah i am
[  509.48-  510.00] FEO070: yeah
[  510.00-  510.22] FEO070: yeah
[  510.00-  518.64] MEE071: it is not it is not under the wall yeah yeah oh yeah it goes down very quickly
[  510.00-  512.44] MEE073: it is not it is not under the wall
[  511.76-  530.56] FEO072: especially if you have a touch pad sometimes she goes oh well i will i will check what it does on on double click at the moment cause i think it might do something but but yeah but i do not i do not i d really do not see anything obvious that at the end
[  515.60-  517.80] MEE073: yeah sure
[  521.62-  526.54] FEO070: yeah
[  521.78-  522.08] MEE073: ok
[  526.92-  527.20] MEE071: yeah
[  532.32-  533.62] FEO072: i mean if we can think of something like
[  537.16-  537.60] FEO070: oh
[  538.68-  539.14] FEO072: so
[  542.34-  544.52] FEO070: i guess it depends on the
[  546.28-  548.84] FEO070: yeah what you are clicking on so
[  548.60-  556.58] FEO072: so yeah another thing single audio files do we want to use them or not
[  549.82-  550.00] MEE073: yeah
[  558.62-  561.56] MEE071: we do not know yet do we davy do you mean single channel
[  561.76-  565.24] FEO072: yeah single cha the single channel files do we want them i mean
[  561.92-  562.52] FEO070: single channel
[  565.80-  570.00] MEE071: probably not but we might need them for the fluences if we turn to look at
[  567.00-  567.32] FEO070: no
[  569.34-  569.88] MEE073: yeah
[  569.36-  570.00] FEO072: yeah or
[  570.00-  578.32] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah i mean we might use them well to work with them but do we want to integrate them so that when you browse we can
[  570.00-  575.00] MEE071: audio but at the moment no but
[  570.00-  571.22] MEE073: they yeah yeah
[  577.92-  581.00] MEE071: we might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person is saying
[  581.38-  585.66] FEO072: do you though i mean it is not going to make much sense if you listen to it on its own do you so
[  581.94-  582.60] FEO070: no
[  585.06-  589.80] MEE071: unless you can not hear it properly or something somebody is talking over some of the ls or something or
[  590.96-  593.98] MEE071: we will just say no for now and put it in maybe or something yeah
[  592.90-  594.66] FEO072: oh yeah
[  595.96-  596.28] FEO072: yeah
[  596.80-  600.00] MEE071: yeah cause otherwise it will b the it will increase the amount of data
[  600.00-  603.32] MEE071: they are probably not going to the footprint of everything
[  601.54-  601.88] FEO072: yeah
[  606.80-  607.32] FEO072: and
[  610.04-  616.22] FEO072: yeah w what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that you have mentioned do you think do you think it is really good
[  615.40-  620.64] MEE073: i think we probably need that though to have the the full flexibility we need to have that but
[  619.08-  626.12] FEO072: that is what i feel as well i mean i am i am very much i i want to have everything customisable
[  626.36-  630.00] MEE073: well the thing is typically though is someone going to have five windows open at the same time probably
[  630.00-  636.50] MEE073: not probably just two or two or three of whatever whenever they are looking at like dialog next or whatever that kind of is
[  631.00-  647.82] FEO072: probably not no yeah two or three maybe but yeah but yeah it depends i mean i i really want to put the summary in somewhere you know and the summary for example is typical you open the window you read through it you might click on you know close it again straight away but it would be good to have it there
[  646.20-  649.68] MEE071: yeah and i think it is i think it is fine i think it is fine
[  646.58-  647.26] MEE073: yeah
[  647.00-  647.28] FEO070: yeah
[  648.34-  656.36] FEO070: but well currently i mean you probably i do not know if you want to have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time
[  657.56-  660.00] FEO070: so maybe you can just like choose
[  660.00-  663.44] FEO070: use the s same window for transcription and summary
[  662.00-  662.36] MEE073: yeah
[  663.64-  666.60] MEE073: it is like have a tab there or something about it you
[  665.00-  667.08] FEO072: oh yeah yeah
[  665.32-  673.46] FEO070: yeah yeah tests are nice i like tests yeah yeah
[  669.14-  671.32] MEE071: yeah tab the good mozilla style yeah
[  669.48-  669.60] MEE073: yeah
[  670.16-  675.08] FEO072: that is true yeah yeah that is right i am not sure yeah
[  674.88-  678.04] FEO070: i do not know if you use i do it is not a key to the test
[  675.16-  681.60] MEE071: does anybody know how to do that can you know java i do not think java knows how to do that really maybe you probably can though but
[  676.28-  682.60] FEO072: yeah yeah i am sure i am sure yeah i am sure you could do anything
[  677.98-  683.20] MEE073: yeah yeah maybe yeah you probably can though yeah
[  680.74-  681.20] FEO070: yeah
[  682.94-  690.00] MEE071: if you really knew what you are doing but i do not know it is a bit of a cripple java has been knowing toolkit the a sometimes it is a bit
[  682.96-  683.42] FEO070: yeah
[  690.00-  690.56] MEE071: another couple
[  691.92-  692.80] FEO072: i can have a look
[  694.14-  694.44] MEE071: yeah
[  694.84-  703.28] FEO070: yeah or just i do not know but yeah that might be like just contents of the same window like from transcription to summary
[  696.94-  698.76] FEO072: but yeah that that might be an idea yeah
[  701.78-  702.44] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  704.34-  704.66] MEE071: yeah
[  704.52-  704.96] FEO070: oh yeah
[  707.76-  712.52] MEE073: yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the tool bar of that window
[  714.44-  714.96] MEE073: something
[  716.04-  720.00] MEE073: a lot of different ways we can do it it does not does not have to be a tab or whatever just kind of here
[  716.24-  717.20] FEO070: yeah yeah that could
[  719.04-  720.00] FEO070: no no it could be
[  720.00-  725.56] FEO070: like transcription summary like two better s and you just press on which you have
[  720.00-  720.74] MEE073: yeah
[  721.88-  722.84] MEE073: yeah that is right
[  723.92-  724.20] MEE071: yeah
[  725.08-  729.56] MEE073: or check marks even have two of them check marks yeah
[  726.16-  738.32] MEE071: yeah that will reduce the number of windows we needed would not it which is probably good cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows if you ever use photoshop it has got loads and you are always could forever going i will get out of the way there is always stuff in the way is in there
[  727.20-  727.46] FEO070: yeah
[  736.16-  738.00] MEE073: yeah very bad
[  739.06-  740.82] FEO070: oh my interface
[  740.42-  748.70] FEO072: but i mean people get used to it i mean w when you use a windows or minux for a matter you have a lot of windows open when you manage them
[  741.40-  741.58] MEE071: yeah
[  747.76-  749.68] MEE071: you do yeah yeah
[  749.44-  749.70] MEE073: yeah
[  751.80-  752.06] MEE073: true
[  752.04-  762.84] MEE071: yeah unless can you i do not suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that can you can you do that now ok well that is alright yeah yeah well of course you can just can use
[  753.88-  754.84] FEO070: it is the
[  756.36-  758.24] FEO072: yeah you can minimize them yeah yeah
[  757.88-  758.68] MEE073: yeah ok
[  761.36-  779.48] MEE073: yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can you know transcript with all the disfluency transcript with the diflu disfluency have all these you know have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually with the disculency
[  762.34-  762.64] FEO070: yeah
[  769.72-  771.72] FEO072: yeah that is true they are they are definitely
[  773.12-  775.24] FEO072: yeah they are definitely going to be in the same window yeah
[  777.76-  778.22] FEO070: ok
[  778.22-  780.00] FEO072: exquisite yeah that
[  780.00-  782.72] FEO072: that was the plan for the disparities anyway so
[  781.92-  782.14] MEE073: yeah
[  784.04-  789.14] FEO072: yeah do you want to do that with summaries then put the summaries in in the same window
[  790.24-  791.40] FEO072: neutually exclusively
[  790.78-  803.88] FEO070: yeah well could i do not know with transcripts it sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then like full meeting meeting without displeancies and summaries
[  800.36-  800.68] MEE073: right
[  803.20-  806.64] FEO072: summaries yeah do you want to do that yeah
[  804.48-  805.88] MEE073: yeah that kind of make sense
[  805.92-  806.12] FEO070: yeah
[  806.88-  807.92] MEE071: yeah transcript
[  810.36-  811.44] FEO070: alright
[  816.58-  822.38] FEO072: and formerly the prototype you should play for them what kind of prototype could we produce
[  823.08-  823.96] MEE073: point in february
[  824.28-  836.48] FEO072: cause i am i am just you know i go into the lab and i say like what am i going to change today you know and it kind of just it just develops i am not aiming for anything do we want to aim for something
[  841.52-  846.76] FEO072: i am i am pretty much getting there anyway to be honest it is not it is not going to be a lot more work
[  846.64-  856.32] FEO070: i guess it is i mean just to try and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so we s yeah yeah
[  854.58-  856.08] MEE073: yeah that is what we need yeah
[  854.70-  860.16] MEE071: yeah that is what we need yeah something just slightly more than just that on the same so we can plug it in just
[  856.50-  856.82] FEO072: alright
[  858.54-  859.84] MEE073: yeah so we can plug it in
[  858.82-  864.72] FEO070: yeah yeah just so see the integration works so which we can be a little kind
[  865.12-  865.76] FEO072: true
[  865.36-  866.42] MEE071: yeah definitely
[  866.84-  867.46] FEO070: i do not know
[  868.88-  870.00] FEO070: so i guess that is what
[  870.00-  871.00] FEO070: in the table as well
[  870.94-  876.16] MEE071: i think that is kinda way meant as well is not it really seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just being
[  872.78-  873.08] FEO070: yeah
[  876.34-  877.48] FEO072: oh that is kind of cool
[  878.02-  879.20] MEE071: a prototype of the gui
[  879.32-  888.68] FEO070: yeah well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down so i guess
[  886.42-  889.76] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  891.96-  900.00] MEE073: actually is the code accessible like the the gui stuff that you have done there like can we just like copulate the latest stuff out of your directory or something
[  900.00-  905.98] MEE073: like if we are going to just try and like take a look or something try and just plug on some i think we can if
[  900.40-  905.24] FEO072: for your i do not know can we access other people is
[  905.04-  907.84] MEE071: you can make it if you make it world readable then anybody can
[  907.32-  912.64] MEE073: well if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we would know the directory to get in and and just
[  910.52-  910.82] MEE071: yeah
[  912.44-  917.36] FEO072: yeah sure i do not know if it is readable at the moment but you can show how to have a look
[  913.62-  915.06] MEE073: that might be might be a new
[  916.50-  920.16] MEE073: yeah i think by default they are not or
[  916.82-  925.44] MEE071: right it no they are not world readable they are not they are develop they are only develop then only you can read them you can see them but you can not read them
[  918.32-  918.64] FEO070: yeah
[  920.16-  920.50] FEO070: i
[  922.52-  924.20] MEE073: right ok
[  923.64-  924.22] FEO072: oh right
[  925.56-  930.00] FEO072: yeah right well i will make that readable then so
[  925.64-  926.52] MEE073: ok alright
[  927.86-  928.14] MEE073: ok
[  928.00-  928.36] MEE071: yeah
[  930.00-  932.42] FEO072: the directory is my number
[  932.60-  936.28] MEE073: or you could just email to a s ok yeah yeah yeah right yeah right ok
[  934.68-  946.76] FEO072: well this is not difficult it is in all the emails no o four o four five five five
[  936.42-  937.60] MEE071: what is your number
[  937.36-  937.80] MEE073: ok
[  939.20-  943.74] MEE073: yeah excellent
[  940.00-  941.36] MEE071: ok your number
[  943.96-  944.34] MEE071: ok
[  948.52-  949.06] FEO072: six o
[  949.80-  950.82] FEO070: say that again o four
[  950.76-  952.54] FEO072: o four five five five six o
[  952.96-  953.82] MEE071: and then it is
[  954.92-  958.32] FEO072: and then there is a folder n l s s d
[  958.84-  959.40] MEE071: n l s s d
[  959.54-  960.00] FEO072: and it is called
[  960.00-  961.82] FEO072: the m browser
[  962.52-  964.76] MEE071: the n browser
[  963.72-  966.32] FEO072: yes m for meeting
[  964.04-  966.06] MEE073: overcase
[  966.06-  982.36] MEE071: i hope you hope you never have to look in my direction but it is just pure chaos mine is serious chaos
[  970.00-  975.86] FEO072: do you mean no i am i am extremely overhand with it i have got folds everything i love folds
[  986.52-  989.28] FEO072: yep so that is me then someone else want to over a little
[  991.94-  994.72] MEE071: final job at once
[  994.48-  996.96] FEO070: i can tell you what as i am an s b t
[  996.86-  998.78] MEE071: yeah
[  997.52-  999.14] MEE073: right
[  999.98- 1011.60] FEO070: oh i do not know i basically i started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there is anything out there to use sort of just
[ 1011.40- 1012.94] FEO072: what were you doing again
[ 1012.90- 1019.64] MEE073: yeah all the searching stuff i think there is going to be a little file stuff and the the next search query and all that yeah
[ 1013.08- 1020.00] FEO070: yeah so yeah yeah so yeah so just ok found a
[ 1015.18- 1016.04] FEO072: ok
[ 1015.80- 1017.32] MEE071: yeah we are all fine
[ 1018.98- 1019.32] FEO072: ok
[ 1020.00- 1024.76] FEO070: tutorial but i i inverted search indexing but i have not yet indexed that
[ 1022.54- 1031.48] MEE073: yeah so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question you asked me earlier just you know the we are using code and stuff and just like ok ok
[ 1024.28- 1024.76] FEO072: indexing
[ 1027.14- 1029.00] FEO070: yeah yeah
[ 1028.16- 1028.76] FEO072: oh
[ 1030.10- 1032.40] FEO072: oh right well that is pretty much there is it
[ 1030.96- 1031.12] FEO070: yeah
[ 1031.00- 1033.44] MEE071: i have found some code for it for the in the
[ 1032.80- 1041.48] FEO070: yeah well i do not know if it is usable i c i have not looked at it but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing yeah
[ 1032.88- 1033.70] MEE073: oh ok
[ 1035.60- 1037.88] MEE073: yeah
[ 1035.84- 1036.22] MEE071: ok
[ 1037.96- 1038.82] FEO072: of making
[ 1039.76- 1045.02] MEE071: oh right cool cool so even if it does not work you can jiggerly pipe a grid around and make it out properly
[ 1040.70- 1041.40] FEO072: oh right
[ 1041.04- 1041.28] MEE073: yeah
[ 1044.22- 1050.00] MEE073: yeah probably we will probably still have to do some other file management where i am i do not know like create shape of messing around thing
[ 1044.58- 1045.28] FEO070: yep yep
[ 1048.32- 1050.00] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah some sort of nonsense
[ 1050.00- 1052.20] MEE071: what yeah the basics is there oh ok that is ok
[ 1050.00- 1050.20] MEE073: that
[ 1050.60- 1050.92] FEO070: yeah
[ 1052.00- 1052.44] FEO070: yeah
[ 1053.14- 1053.92] FEO072: yeah that is handy
[ 1054.68- 1056.80] FEO070: yeah
[ 1056.48- 1058.00] FEO072: so you think it should not be too difficult
[ 1060.16- 1077.72] FEO070: i do not know i am i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with file let us know with files i mean how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from the x m l files and stuff to be able to do the indexing
[ 1077.96- 1080.00] FEO072: oh i see yeah yeah
[ 1079.62- 1080.00] MEE071: yeah
[ 1080.00- 1082.54] FEO072: have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
[ 1082.64- 1082.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 1083.44- 1103.62] MEE071: i have been trying to write something to read the x m l and get rid of it and i can get rid of it but i am having trouble putting it anywhere else so it will come up on the screen but at the moment i have not managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it but i guess it is not very difficult yeah java
[ 1092.52- 1095.90] MEE073: right right
[ 1095.60- 1096.12] FEO070: ok
[ 1099.62- 1104.98] FEO070: ok right what are you writing in jala or yeah ok
[ 1101.18- 1101.50] MEE073: like it is
[ 1103.92- 1104.12] MEE073: right
[ 1106.42- 1108.40] FEO070: yeah we are not much about found
[ 1106.72- 1110.00] FEO072: i mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then because
[ 1110.00- 1116.38] FEO072: you know they already extract for example transcripts or to work at least
[ 1114.40- 1117.50] MEE071: yeah yeah i am sure they do yeah
[ 1118.40- 1119.00] MEE073: that is a good idea
[ 1119.40- 1130.48] MEE071: yeah oh yeah i am sure if i am just i am sure i am making a name of it at the level actually
[ 1133.94- 1140.00] FEO070: yeah i guess i mean it was a good point he had that like
[ 1140.00- 1148.40] FEO070: collaborate and with the profile things i mean if you are already started on on stuff i guess we can
[ 1142.24- 1142.56] MEE073: yeah
[ 1145.72- 1147.52] MEE071: yeah absolutely
[ 1148.90- 1150.24] MEE071: should share as much as possible
[ 1150.22- 1150.72] FEO070: yeah
[ 1150.78- 1152.04] MEE073: libraries
[ 1152.76- 1153.12] MEE071: yeah
[ 1153.38- 1156.36] FEO070: yeah should we i dunno
[ 1153.54- 1153.72] MEE073: yeah
[ 1158.28- 1169.72] FEO070: meet up and see what we could do i mean i dunno see what you have done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe
[ 1164.64- 1165.04] MEE071: yeah
[ 1164.72- 1170.00] MEE073: yeah yeah exactly exactly
[ 1167.28- 1170.00] MEE071: next weeks i will die
[ 1170.00- 1186.68] MEE071: they actually have not done anything this week as this week has been manic but it is not well whatever it was last week the the the week as as is rather than the proper week you know i mean it has been all a bit manic the last last week
[ 1170.00- 1171.96] MEE073: so you are still working
[ 1173.64- 1180.48] MEE073: yes exactly same way yep i mean betw oh that is
[ 1173.92- 1175.60] FEO070: yeah
[ 1175.26- 1177.72] FEO072: i mean this week is only two days old
[ 1178.64- 1180.40] FEO070: i i would not say
[ 1178.92- 1180.16] FEO072: oh last week
[ 1184.16- 1184.28] MEE073: right
[ 1185.78- 1189.88] MEE073: well well you are in s p and l p and s p two right so yeah that is where i am
[ 1188.20- 1196.04] MEE071: that is right yeah and then we had to do an i r p whatever it was last week as well which is only a page one but it is quite difficult to run a page
[ 1188.62- 1188.84] FEO070: yep
[ 1193.94- 1194.08] MEE073: oh
[ 1196.52- 1197.72] MEE073: yeah oh
[ 1196.90- 1200.00] FEO072: yeah that is complete rubbish yeah
[ 1197.96- 1200.00] MEE071: well it was it was not
[ 1200.00- 1201.84] FEO072: so cheap
[ 1200.00- 1210.28] MEE071: but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit and i just you know my s pen i think
[ 1205.86- 1207.00] MEE073: yeah that is fun
[ 1209.32- 1209.56] MEE073: what
[ 1211.16- 1226.04] MEE073: kay so yeah i was thinking that we can probably get start attacking this seriously let me just you know hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the group that kind of think that should be possible
[ 1214.16- 1215.36] FEO070: yeah hopefully maybe yeah
[ 1216.04- 1216.26] MEE071: yeah
[ 1223.92- 1224.18] FEO070: yeah
[ 1225.10- 1230.00] FEO072: well the browser as i use it now or as you know it was there
[ 1225.20- 1225.98] FEO070: well
[ 1230.00- 1243.72] FEO072: when i took it it uses the the n x t search to get the data out of the out of the files which i think is odd but i am not quite sure how it works it i do not quite understand
[ 1236.96- 1238.08] MEE073: yeah
[ 1244.84- 1246.34] MEE071: so when it when it
[ 1247.36- 1255.72] FEO072: to get the data for example to get the summarization data you have to search for i think the i d s or something yeah
[ 1256.44- 1259.52] MEE071: that is pretty bizarre is not it well i guess it is like where it is we have got the
[ 1257.54- 1258.08] FEO072: yeah
[ 1261.62- 1262.72] MEE071: that is pretty bizarre
[ 1263.72- 1269.08] FEO072: so they do not you know they do not say look in that and that folder but they say search everything
[ 1267.18- 1268.28] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 1270.52- 1271.30] MEE071: that is pretty bizarre
[ 1272.76- 1281.24] MEE073: well they did not say it was not the most efficient very clearly yeah
[ 1274.48- 1279.16] FEO070: oh it does load up quite quickly
[ 1277.56- 1283.00] FEO072: it does lay down quite quickly so yeah it is not too bad you know can have a look
[ 1280.40- 1290.00] FEO070: ok but but what what is it like a window where you have to r write a search square or is it just what is behind it so or what is working on it
[ 1289.16- 1290.00] FEO072: no this is not the
[ 1290.00- 1291.52] FEO070: ok ok
[ 1290.00- 1306.68] FEO072: actual search this is just when you open w you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for a certain meeting it does does an n x d search for the string i do not know transcript or text or whatever
[ 1295.18- 1295.40] FEO070: yeah
[ 1296.98- 1297.18] FEO070: yeah
[ 1306.04- 1306.34] FEO070: ok
[ 1306.98- 1313.68] MEE071: four and it what i like it just has an open variable transcript this whatever find everything that has got there and then like
[ 1310.68- 1310.92] FEO072: yeah
[ 1313.24- 1320.00] FEO072: yeah so i do not know if you have looked at the search query language but it is like a dollar a sort of
[ 1319.52- 1320.00] MEE071: yeah ok
[ 1319.66- 1319.88] FEO070: ok
[ 1319.84- 1320.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1320.00- 1320.72] FEO072: text say
[ 1320.00- 1326.84] MEE071: yeah yeah cause that is the the guy could declares a variable does not it and he could probably take them
[ 1320.00- 1320.12] MEE073: text
[ 1323.90- 1330.08] FEO072: yeah and then yeah because every every year all of these
[ 1331.46- 1341.60] FEO072: these files have got an i d and all the transcript file has got the string i do not know what it is words or text or something in it so just searches for those files
[ 1342.36- 1342.76] FEO070: ok
[ 1343.00- 1343.40] MEE071: right
[ 1343.24- 1343.68] FEO072: there you go
[ 1345.60- 1349.96] FEO070: when you like is there a open thingy or
[ 1345.68- 1345.96] FEO072: yeah
[ 1350.00- 1358.20] FEO070: partie like wh what did you do to like how did we figure out that this uses mixtape search like is it
[ 1350.04- 1350.28] FEO072: yeah
[ 1357.48- 1370.44] FEO072: it is well it is in the code just that it you know it you you define a search object and then you search that string i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary that is how i
[ 1361.22- 1361.56] FEO070: ok
[ 1364.92- 1365.22] FEO070: ok
[ 1372.00- 1376.56] FEO072: i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself
[ 1372.10- 1373.20] MEE071: oh you see i was
[ 1376.64- 1379.28] MEE071: so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is what we did
[ 1379.32- 1380.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 1380.00- 1383.02] FEO072: just search for a specific string
[ 1383.46- 1383.80] MEE071: alright
[ 1385.36- 1385.80] MEE071: ok
[ 1385.40- 1392.36] FEO072: so you could just you know you could use that when you if you want to take the data out for example yeah
[ 1391.32- 1393.28] MEE071: pish the data out i was just thinking that yeah
[ 1393.12- 1393.46] FEO070: yeah
[ 1396.68- 1405.56] FEO072: if you have a a question about what the the code means or where to find the code that you want to you know whatever you want to do then just send me an email
[ 1397.00- 1397.36] FEO070: yeah
[ 1406.84- 1407.68] FEO072: i can explain it
[ 1408.28- 1408.52] FEO070: yeah
[ 1408.84- 1410.00] MEE071: have you annotated your code
[ 1410.00- 1413.48] MEE071: oh yeah
[ 1410.72- 1435.96] FEO072: oh yeah actually in the moment it has got a load of rubbish because the the the browser that i used from this from you know that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in and i have not dared throw an out to throw out all the functions i have you know that i do not need yeah just in case exactly yes so they are all in there yeah still a lot of rubbish but it will be good it will be chucked down right at the end i think
[ 1411.68- 1412.76] MEE073: yeah
[ 1424.82- 1429.56] MEE071: just in case it was mission critical yeah
[ 1425.04- 1426.24] MEE073: injection
[ 1436.88- 1440.00] MEE071: comming commenting it out one bit at a time and running it does it work yeah
[ 1439.28- 1440.00] FEO072: yes it is
[ 1439.78- 1440.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1440.00- 1443.32] FEO072: let us go yeah precisely
[ 1440.00- 1447.08] MEE071: i think we can go to that next good fun
[ 1444.48- 1444.92] FEO070: ok
[ 1446.68- 1446.92] FEO070: yeah
[ 1452.00- 1452.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 1452.08- 1458.06] MEE071: so basically we go on condition work maybe that is it on the weekend
[ 1454.16- 1455.76] MEE073: yeah sure so how many weekend
[ 1455.44- 1460.60] FEO072: ok but weekend but weekend is still four days off
[ 1458.22- 1458.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 1460.04- 1468.38] MEE073: yeah how many hours is this yeah
[ 1461.24- 1466.00] MEE071: yeah four still at the bottom of the mountain
[ 1465.04- 1465.70] FEO072: ok
[ 1467.52- 1469.52] FEO072: i do not actually have that much to do at the minute
[ 1467.60- 1468.30] MEE071: yeah
[ 1470.00- 1484.08] MEE071: well since you phoned in want to explore any other well how how is your how is your quantifier raising
[ 1471.24- 1476.04] FEO072: oh dear well
[ 1472.50- 1475.68] FEO070: oh dear
[ 1473.74- 1474.60] MEE073: yeah i am so
[ 1480.12- 1482.92] MEE073: yeah yeah i am not sure
[ 1483.08- 1487.52] FEO072: i can not remember what i am supposed to do by the way am i supposed to do the summarization thing you bought
[ 1494.00- 1494.36] FEO072: no
[ 1495.54- 1496.14] MEE073: who is doing that
[ 1499.32- 1500.00] FEO072: you do
[ 1499.74- 1500.00] MEE073: oh no
[ 1500.00- 1503.00] FEO072: well i will do that then
[ 1500.00- 1501.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1500.60- 1504.82] FEO070: yeah
[ 1500.72- 1501.92] MEE071: you can do something
[ 1502.12- 1512.20] MEE073: these can be changed now i do not know it does not matter if if you want to i mean it is just you know play around with some extra stuff if you have some time why not
[ 1504.40- 1505.80] FEO072: shall i do that then i mean
[ 1507.00- 1507.72] FEO072: well you know
[ 1512.36- 1513.56] FEO072: it should not be too difficult
[ 1516.90- 1521.40] MEE071: so what courses should i have picked are we not doing any work
[ 1519.14- 1524.10] FEO070: yeah that is this
[ 1521.12- 1530.00] FEO072: well i am doing communications which we had one exercise and i have done that like two weeks ago and that is in in two weeks
[ 1530.24- 1537.72] MEE073: is that in informatics course or oh like digital right ok ok
[ 1532.88- 1537.62] FEO072: yeah so nine nine courses or ten or something yeah
[ 1533.20- 1533.46] MEE071: yeah
[ 1537.84- 1539.00] MEE071: well i suppose in yeah
[ 1539.00- 1547.80] FEO072: and then i am doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that was in like friday
[ 1539.68- 1539.92] MEE073: right
[ 1551.52- 1557.64] FEO072: well i am not doing any backhanding so you know
[ 1553.64- 1556.60] MEE073: right
[ 1557.24- 1560.00] FEO070: sorry this is a big
[ 1558.28- 1559.90] MEE073: right
[ 1561.64- 1565.62] MEE073: yeah i will be happy when this week is over
[ 1564.32- 1565.28] MEE071: yeah
[ 1564.68- 1565.12] FEO072: that is good
[ 1565.12- 1570.64] FEO070: p have you happy week is cautious over ok yeah
[ 1567.12- 1574.68] MEE073: yeah well anyway is that about it then anything else we need to discuss
[ 1571.84- 1572.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 1574.36- 1574.92] FEO070: i do not know
[ 1576.52- 1580.52] MEE073: did we want to meet before we talk to steve next week
[ 1582.98- 1590.00] MEE073: well i dunno we will probably get some work done over the weekend so i know f after the m l g or something maybe just have a little quicker
[ 1586.72- 1587.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 1590.00- 1591.00] MEE073: little update and just
[ 1592.32- 1599.94] FEO072: yeah if you like we can always decide then i mean yeah yeah so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then
[ 1593.84- 1596.28] MEE073: yeah well we can decide yeah exactly yeah
[ 1595.68- 1595.96] FEO070: yeah
[ 1600.36- 1620.00] MEE073: search and like it could not be that hard well it will be you know still a limited version of you know the next query will not be the whole thing but like we can just decide sort of the things that we do want to do you know
[ 1602.04- 1605.76] FEO072: you are going to do the search you are going to implement the search
[ 1604.96- 1605.88] FEO070: yeah
[ 1607.62- 1608.00] FEO070: yeah
[ 1620.00- 1623.86] MEE073: well actually most of just dialect accent and this was
[ 1620.66- 1620.96] FEO072: yeah
[ 1631.08- 1633.46] MEE073: summary topic strange
[ 1633.32- 1633.94] FEO070: ok
[ 1638.28- 1638.56] MEE073: yeah
[ 1638.92- 1642.94] FEO072: it is just that i think we need to set ourselves on milestones because otherwise
[ 1639.14- 1639.54] FEO070: ok
[ 1642.00- 1642.24] MEE073: yeah
[ 1644.84- 1645.32] FEO072: you know
[ 1647.32- 1650.00] MEE073: yeah we would get a high schedule yeah pretty quick
[ 1647.82- 1649.00] FEO072: we sort of mind
[ 1650.00- 1655.80] MEE073: kay like you are saying yeah well actually do we want to set a date for interim prototype
[ 1657.00- 1658.20] MEE073: specifically a date
[ 1660.80- 1661.44] FEO070: oh yes
[ 1661.46- 1664.20] FEO072: well you decide i am not very much for that project
[ 1664.64- 1665.60] MEE071: oh
[ 1667.78- 1674.30] FEO070: the progress report is june twenty third right february
[ 1672.96- 1673.40] FEO072: of
[ 1674.72- 1675.02] FEO072: oh
[ 1675.36- 1677.56] MEE071: so so what is that two weeks please
[ 1677.30- 1678.88] FEO070: yeah
[ 1678.92- 1680.00] FEO072: well how about
[ 1680.00- 1681.84] FEO072: we get it done by then i mean
[ 1682.78- 1684.00] MEE071: ish yeah
[ 1684.44- 1689.72] FEO072: then we can write about it in the in the interim report you know now we have got something to show
[ 1687.80- 1688.18] FEO070: yeah
[ 1687.94- 1690.56] MEE071: yeah ok so
[ 1697.00- 1697.42] FEO070: yeah
[ 1699.20- 1705.94] FEO070: just looking at my own deadlines i think yeah
[ 1705.36- 1708.24] FEO072: oh and the the search interface
[ 1710.84- 1723.96] FEO072: maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for and then if you want you can give up to me and i will i will build you nice you know few tick boxes and drop down menus
[ 1717.20- 1717.38] MEE073: yeah
[ 1724.94- 1731.84] FEO070: was not like what you have now was not that pretty much a little breakdown or was it just like someone
[ 1728.50- 1728.94] FEO072: no
[ 1730.30- 1740.00] FEO072: oh that is that is that does not exist that is completely cut and pasted that does not exist nicely done though
[ 1736.02- 1736.24] MEE073: yeah
[ 1736.16- 1737.64] FEO070: ok
[ 1740.00- 1754.88] FEO072: is not it cause actually all these all these things are are nicked from you know all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google online a screenshot of google
[ 1740.32- 1746.20] FEO070: yeah it is actually all these all these things are are nicked
[ 1740.56- 1743.64] MEE071: yeah that is that is quite impressive actually
[ 1742.46- 1744.16] MEE073: s someone is appreciated
[ 1752.74- 1753.08] MEE073: yes
[ 1755.08- 1755.88] FEO070: oh
[ 1756.92- 1762.66] FEO070: that is not maybe we should make it exist then
[ 1759.64- 1763.14] MEE071: that is quite so amazing
[ 1759.74- 1770.00] FEO072: it is just so much fun it is going to be a little difficult more difficult yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus are
[ 1770.00- 1776.52] FEO072: stuff what we want to search for is not quite agreed on we never agreed on what we want to be able to search for
[ 1776.60- 1777.64] MEE071: nice and noisy yeah
[ 1776.66- 1779.62] MEE073: no it is not easy yeah yeah decide on that on over the weekend
[ 1777.80- 1778.20] FEO072: so
[ 1779.80- 1789.28] FEO072: yeah i do want to you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do and then and then we could discuss at next meeting which options we really want to include
[ 1781.12- 1781.30] MEE073: yeah
[ 1791.16- 1791.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 1791.36- 1796.04] FEO072: that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do
[ 1794.96- 1795.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 1798.72- 1800.00] FEO070: it would be nice to
[ 1800.00- 1809.88] FEO070: meet up and you can sort of show us a bit of you know already so we do not sort of have to do all the work again you know just like figuring out stuff
[ 1810.28- 1813.76] MEE073: oh just like the basics of like sure
[ 1810.62- 1811.04] FEO072: no
[ 1812.12- 1813.06] FEO072: no already what
[ 1813.92- 1816.84] FEO070: just like accessing the corpus and stuff
[ 1816.28- 1816.74] FEO072: oh
[ 1816.84- 1830.00] MEE073: yeah just like all the and seeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you have done like just get a a quick look over and just look at the search yeah or like like the you know the class paths all that sort of thing like just just say ok well here is you know
[ 1823.06- 1828.20] MEE071: can take us for a tutorial yeah or the like the you know the class paths all that sort of thing would just
[ 1823.52- 1823.70] FEO072: yeah
[ 1824.68- 1827.80] FEO070: yeah
[ 1829.70- 1830.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 1830.00- 1831.30] FEO072: yeah you can do that
[ 1830.00- 1833.32] MEE073: everything is basic all set up and then just yeah just jump right in
[ 1831.52- 1831.80] FEO070: yeah
[ 1832.48- 1834.32] FEO072: show you the bits the code
[ 1834.42- 1834.66] MEE073: yeah
[ 1835.76- 1842.92] MEE073: yeah yeah in the morning
[ 1835.94- 1838.64] MEE071: next week
[ 1836.04- 1836.22] FEO072: yeah
[ 1841.00- 1848.84] FEO072: oh yeah well this time i am doing taken it is hard to put your bag of bag on there you can not do anything
[ 1845.02- 1860.00] MEE073: yeah yeah well thing is yeah yeah something like that could happen anytime cause you know like my schedule is like a class break class break class you know that sort of thing so yeah i know exactly exactly that is what i am thinking so
[ 1856.32- 1858.64] FEO072: yeah i thought i am going to take an hour to explain to you
[ 1858.52- 1859.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 1860.00- 1860.36] FEO072: i mean
[ 1860.00- 1864.80] MEE073: something like that and then if i have a class i can run off do whatever yeah ok
[ 1862.60- 1862.92] FEO070: yeah
[ 1862.74- 1867.06] FEO072: pick a time yeah let me know whenever
[ 1865.12- 1866.30] FEO070: yeah
[ 1866.12- 1868.22] MEE073: actually mondays monday might be good so
[ 1868.14- 1868.40] FEO070: yeah
[ 1868.66- 1870.80] FEO072: what monday what did you say
[ 1870.24- 1871.10] MEE073: yeah
[ 1870.52- 1872.12] FEO070: six yeah this monday just
[ 1872.36- 1880.54] MEE073: anytime not at not at noon or two or four no in between those yeah like one or three or
[ 1873.12- 1890.00] MEE071: yeah
[ 1881.00- 1883.16] FEO072: three o clock actually yeah
[ 1881.96- 1882.12] MEE073: sure
[ 1884.28- 1884.72] MEE073: possibly
[ 1886.92- 1887.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 1888.34- 1889.02] FEO070: it is for yeah
[ 1888.86- 1890.00] FEO072: unless you want to do it after the
[ 1889.12- 1889.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 1890.00- 1892.20] FEO072: after
[ 1891.56- 1893.84] MEE073: yeah that is an option too after
[ 1893.28- 1893.68] FEO072: dean
[ 1895.32- 1896.52] MEE073: sure
[ 1895.92- 1900.12] MEE071: three is good though but we have i thought well what should what would you prefer
[ 1896.08- 1896.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 1899.14- 1905.48] MEE073: or three thirty i just yeah that is necessary we necessarily sure
[ 1903.40- 1906.58] FEO070: well does not have to run in three three or after four
[ 1903.76- 1904.68] FEO072: that is the same time
[ 1904.68- 1913.74] MEE071: three thirty in the in the computer room in here and then maybe just go if you can not can you get in the front door oh you have not got a key do you can none of you get in
[ 1907.28- 1908.76] MEE073: actually we can get in there though
[ 1910.50- 1911.04] FEO070: right
[ 1912.60- 1918.10] MEE073: oh we well we can get in through the through the the car the car door yeah
[ 1913.92- 1915.12] FEO072: yeah i have found out
[ 1915.80- 1920.00] MEE071: the c the f this computer rooms in here the m s c computer thing right
[ 1916.30- 1917.08] FEO070: the car hold the car
[ 1918.62- 1919.80] FEO072: i have not found that yet
[ 1920.00- 1930.82] MEE071: yeah well if you find me i will show you where i will i will let us all in there and we can all go in there yeah you do need to have a key for it like that is the thing it has got a locked door button
[ 1920.04- 1927.80] MEE073: how about if we take a turn yeah exactly
[ 1923.42- 1928.08] FEO070: we can do look we can look it now afterwards yeah
[ 1929.76- 1937.56] MEE073: ok just sort of bang on it i was just asking steve about that whether we can get in there whether he is going to get us access into the
[ 1929.86- 1930.20] FEO070: ok
[ 1932.20- 1933.26] MEE071: yeah somebody will answer
[ 1938.04- 1940.28] FEO070: into what ok yeah
[ 1938.68- 1939.22] MEE073: the computer world
[ 1940.36- 1947.96] MEE071: yeah it has only got it is crap it has only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite good for our job because it can also it is not very abnormally with people in it very
[ 1942.96- 1943.50] MEE073: ok right
[ 1945.10- 1945.38] MEE073: ok
[ 1947.76- 1948.20] FEO070: oh
[ 1947.92- 1949.60] MEE073: right is there a printer there too
[ 1950.00- 1958.76] MEE071: sportion and there is a photocopier with the code on it yeah and it is
[ 1952.68- 1953.08] FEO072: really
[ 1953.94- 1956.72] MEE073: nice right from behind you just got it
[ 1954.72- 1955.18] FEO072: really
[ 1956.78- 1958.44] FEO072: oh well i am just
[ 1957.64- 1960.88] FEO070: well i am just what i have heard of it so
[ 1957.74- 1965.76] MEE073: hey if we could we should photocop your assignment if we want to yeah well the comments i am thinking
[ 1961.76- 1965.24] FEO072: i have got it on my computer whatever else it might be
[ 1963.02- 1963.24] FEO070: yeah
[ 1964.30- 1964.64] FEO070: yeah
[ 1965.88- 1967.64] FEO070: so what time do we say
[ 1968.08- 1974.12] FEO072: i just think it is better to do it afterwards than we have all the time we need yeah than half half an hour and then we will eventually run out
[ 1968.08- 1968.36] MEE073: that is
[ 1970.64- 1973.52] MEE073: yeah that is true so after dm l g yeah
[ 1971.00- 1971.32] MEE071: oh right
[ 1971.36- 1972.20] FEO070: yeah yeah
[ 1973.16- 1973.68] MEE071: yeah
[ 1973.32- 1979.06] FEO070: yeah yeah yeah ok we will
[ 1978.78- 1980.00] MEE073: as long as dm l g does not go
[ 1980.00- 1980.36] MEE073: late
[ 1981.36- 1981.64] FEO072: oh
[ 1981.76- 1984.70] MEE071: hopefully it is not that man is though it will not matter
[ 1986.24- 1994.52] FEO072: actually it is not even confirmed yet what she does not even know what she is talking about now maybe it does not happen at all
[ 1988.64- 1988.84] FEO070: what
[ 1989.00- 1989.28] MEE073: oh
[ 1991.32- 1993.48] FEO070: yeah yeah
[ 1992.86- 1993.06] MEE073: sounds
[ 1994.74- 2003.08] FEO070: yeah no it is reading week next week should be is it reading well it is supposed to be next week it is week six next week
[ 1995.14- 1996.66] MEE073: sounds like me
[ 1997.58- 1998.16] FEO072: is it really
[ 1998.40- 2001.72] MEE073: right week is week or week oh
[ 2002.32- 2002.88] FEO072: really
[ 2003.84- 2004.10] MEE073: oh
[ 2004.08- 2005.96] FEO072: i do not think we have a reading week though do we
[ 2005.54- 2009.88] FEO070: i dunno we have one class at least when we like speech perception we do not have any like
[ 2006.94- 2008.44] MEE073: yeah that is casual
[ 2009.80- 2010.00] MEE073: oh
[ 2010.00- 2015.16] FEO070: first but i think we are having like all other classes so there is not enough point in it
[ 2010.00- 2010.28] MEE073: yeah
[ 2012.80- 2018.70] FEO072: yeah i do not think there was an official i do not think there was an official one last semester i think it was just a back holiday was not it
[ 2019.00- 2021.88] MEE073: something like that i think one or a couple classes are casual
[ 2020.16- 2020.78] FEO070: i think
[ 2021.16- 2026.70] MEE071: some classes did and some classes did not and they looked bizarre really they did not really know what was going to happen
[ 2023.28- 2026.50] MEE073: yeah exactly
[ 2023.48- 2030.04] FEO070: yeah yeah i think the undergraduates had were a total
[ 2026.62- 2027.18] FEO072: oh yeah
[ 2028.12- 2028.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 2029.62- 2040.00] MEE073: he goes up to the professor whether they did it or not well i do not feel like it no i can not i think yeah i think the i l will probably have one to make up for missing classes
[ 2034.36- 2035.92] MEE071: no make it work
[ 2040.00- 2044.32] MEE073: d i l will probably have points as well
[ 2040.58- 2040.82] FEO070: what
[ 2042.24- 2048.94] FEO070: yeah we will probably yeah yeah there has been last week yeah
[ 2047.20- 2049.36] FEO072: ok let us be mambay
[ 2048.06- 2048.20] MEE073: yeah
[ 2050.36- 2051.14] MEE071: dumb
[ 2050.48- 2060.48] FEO070: yeah i guess that is it was there anything else do anyone along here want to like take care of this or should i take care of it
[ 2060.80- 2062.48] MEE073: ok yeah
[ 2060.96- 2061.72] MEE071: oh we trust
[ 2062.28- 2067.32] FEO070: yeah i dunno if there was something oh i think it basically said
[ 2070.00- 2074.88] FEO070: the same things as in the comments if i could read it
[ 2078.04- 2080.76] FEO070: can you read that
[ 2078.18- 2081.92] MEE073: go a second top one ok
[ 2084.36- 2087.32] MEE073: do we really want multiple windows from a single app
[ 2086.54- 2086.72] FEO070: yeah
[ 2088.80- 2090.46] FEO070: i am not thinking of that ok
[ 2089.60- 2092.40] MEE073: but most will probably want to go with defaults
[ 2094.40- 2096.90] FEO070: yeah well that was very safe
[ 2094.68- 2097.18] MEE073: yeah thanks
[ 2096.44- 2098.96] MEE071: yeah i think the comments are basically the same as what you said so
[ 2098.74- 2100.00] MEE073: yeah exactly and just the other
[ 2100.00- 2104.90] MEE073: comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation
[ 2106.22- 2108.58] MEE073: oh can us please turn right side
[ 2107.84- 2117.86] FEO070: well yeah and then we have seven percent do not they of course maybe go pick it nice so if
[ 2109.84- 2110.26] MEE073: ok
[ 2112.12- 2117.26] MEE073: ok so
[ 2114.64- 2116.80] MEE071: yeah
[ 2116.84- 2118.98] FEO072: right so i think we need to take the ok box right
[ 2119.14- 2123.92] FEO070: if you are ok with having i think
[ 2120.08- 2125.02] FEO072: and where the having
[ 2121.20- 2122.94] MEE071: oh it is like buzzes
[ 2125.92- 2127.68] MEE073: oh yeah
[ 2126.00- 2127.68] MEE071: signing off on it yeah
[ 2126.24- 2129.88] FEO070: yeah
[ 2130.00- 2130.24] MEE073: ok
[ 2131.48- 2132.62] FEO072: shall we turn this off or not
[ 2133.92- 2137.42] FEO070: we are done now
[ 2139.28- 2142.36] FEO070: is she still here yes you are yeah

[   24.24-   28.52] FEO070: i can relax what is the phone so
[   28.96-   29.40] MEE073: actually
[   29.32-   30.00] FEO072: i if you could
[   29.44-   29.98] MEE073: if you could
[   32.58-   33.08] MEE073: chance rate
[   36.02-   36.48] FEO070: ok
[   37.00-   38.16] MEE071: ok
[   39.02-   43.80] MEE073: ok i would like to take notes this one i guess i will take notes this one
[   39.76-   39.92] FEO072: ok
[   42.00-   43.72] FEO070: what ok
[   44.94-   46.12] MEE073: a chance i guess
[   45.80-   46.96] FEO070: i will open the room
[   48.28-   60.00] MEE073: actually i guess the first thing we just sorta did a really sort of brief you know version of what we have to do
[   60.00-   62.32] MEE073: share these
[   62.02-   62.52] FEO070: ok
[   82.44-   89.48] FEO070: very interesting start at the meeting yes looking down the meeting
[   85.16-   85.74] MEE071: yeah
[   93.22-   93.48] FEO072: ok
[   93.68-   93.94] MEE071: yeah
[  123.12-  124.14] FEO072: come on timeline
[  124.70-  130.62] MEE073: factually for that i was just copying the one straight over the other document so it is all whatever yeah accurately
[  137.44-  139.46] MEE071: ok yeah i see that is fine
[  137.72-  139.68] MEE073: ok ok
[  139.26-  142.94] FEO072: ok you see it oh that is right yeah
[  141.12-  142.64] MEE073: oh should should should go cool
[  142.20-  143.12] FEO070: yeah
[  144.36-  150.00] FEO072: and i am not sure if we need the outline of the prototype i mean what what we are going to put into the
[  144.52-  144.84] MEE073: kay
[  149.12-  150.00] MEE073: oh
[  150.00-  150.20] FEO072: wow
[  150.00-  168.90] MEE073: well just sorta well the thing is yeah we are going to be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen shots and all nice yeah yeah well it is just something that he had mentioned in the in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together and so just saying that you know we could potentially do that it is not something we have to
[  154.40-  157.48] FEO072: yeah because i mean that is basically what we are doing here is not it the whole
[  167.42-  175.26] MEE071: yeah we could we c this could be just some like just just describe some screenshots or something
[  170.46-  170.58] MEE073: yeah
[  174.68-  175.12] MEE073: yeah
[  177.30-  180.00] MEE073: yeah sure like the thing is i was thinking even you know stuff that i
[  180.00-  191.42] MEE073: was doing i mean just throw the screen shots in there when you talk about what you are doing right ok make sense so yeah oh yes yeah oh actually yeah i had that at the very end screen shots but that did not show up on this page so that is that is relevant so
[  183.60-  185.96] MEE071: yeah you can either have and we can just ignore that or you can have
[  190.18-  190.52] MEE071: yeah
[  191.60-  200.74] MEE071: yeah you can either have it yeah it says screenshot there and stuff but you can either have screenshots by the thing each one or have just a bunch of them in one section
[  194.28-  194.50] MEE073: yeah
[  200.12-  209.34] MEE073: yes anyways so so yeah this is just very general structure i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and i do not know
[  208.88-  210.00] MEE071: yeah i will
[  210.00-  213.80] MEE071: written this up the segmentation one
[  211.32-  211.86] MEE073: alright cool
[  212.48-  213.66] FEO072: yeah
[  213.12-  229.52] MEE073: nice so i dunno if there is other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i mean it with you guys otherwise no did someone else want to throw it together actually i can probably still throw it together if you will i will put your parts into into this one
[  222.76-  223.76] MEE071: that is a three
[  229.84-  240.00] MEE071: i think the pen of this should do it yeah
[  231.24-  233.48] MEE073: yeah perfectionist right yeah
[  231.68-  236.60] FEO072: yeah yes yeah
[  235.12-  240.00] MEE073: yeah let us just cut out the middle man and then we will just get it out
[  237.36-  240.00] FEO070: oh let us just cut out the middle man
[  240.00-  250.92] FEO070: and i am being like i do not know i am not like maybe speak of english but
[  240.00-  247.54] MEE071: you are going to tell us we have got it wrong anyway so
[  240.00-  244.40] MEE073: they are going to tell us we are going wrong anyway
[  253.46-  255.38] FEO070: oh let us
[  253.80-  259.20] FEO072: yeah well i mean it is up to you if you want to keep going with that i am happy to do some as well i have lots of time tonight
[  260.44-  267.16] FEO072: and then i will probably send it to you and you can do the final revision and so
[  264.08-  268.56] MEE071: we can send it you can
[  266.16-  270.00] FEO070: yeah i will look at it like when my if you
[  266.76-  266.96] MEE073: yeah
[  270.00-  300.00] FEO070: usual working hours are like from twelve o clock till three o clock or something so i am not working like that and then i am not working like that so yeah yeah i actually know but i am never online in the morning so
[  275.34-  285.92] FEO072: i know you are always online it always make me feel bad because when i go to bed at like one you are still online you never go to bed
[  275.48-  280.52] MEE073: i know you are always online
[  283.04-  283.36] MEE073: right
[  286.20-  289.66] MEE071: sleep or just leave your computer on maybe
[  286.68-  292.00] MEE073: or just leave your computer on maybe
[  289.20-  294.06] FEO072: yeah you pretend always busy right yeah so maybe
[  296.84-  300.00] MEE073: yeah but notice that no one is
[  296.92-  300.00] FEO072: yeah
[  300.00-  302.60] FEO070: yeah
[  300.00-  303.48] FEO072: so
[  300.00-  302.38] MEE073: right alright
[  304.10-  306.50] MEE073: ok so i will send it off to you and then
[  305.46-  305.80] FEO070: well
[  307.64-  318.10] FEO070: yeah do what you want to do with it first and then i will look ok then i will send it out to you again so whatever
[  307.96-  308.08] MEE073: yeah
[  309.52-  309.86] MEE073: ok
[  311.36-  313.88] MEE071: it is not a challenge
[  311.60-  311.86] MEE073: yeah
[  312.42-  312.80] FEO072: yeah
[  313.28-  314.54] MEE073: ok
[  316.20-  330.00] MEE073: yeah was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline i mean essentially was what like you can not see either it does not know it is crazy old one well that is that is the original yeah yeah it was just copied straight out
[  320.72-  321.20] FEO072: yeah
[  323.86-  328.10] FEO072: oh there is more oh i see oh this is the one that ok
[  331.00-  345.74] FEO070: probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff i think it one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the quality of files
[  345.48-  349.08] FEO072: that is what i thought as well i mean do we are we are we actually going to attempt that
[  346.96-  347.26] MEE073: yeah
[  347.48-  348.18] MEE071: yeah
[  348.20-  352.60] FEO070: yeah no i do not th that is that is too big yeah
[  349.72-  351.84] MEE071: yeah
[  350.60-  355.72] FEO072: i do not think so either yeah i think that is going to be we do not even know how to approach that point i think
[  351.96-  352.36] MEE073: yeah
[  355.60-  355.86] FEO070: no
[  356.12-  356.40] MEE073: yeah
[  357.38-  359.96] MEE071: it is a good thing to have to say we could what we could have done
[  360.00-  368.72] MEE071: if we had more time it is good for you to work thing is not it sticking the conclusion with the final report should if we had more time then we should yeah
[  363.28-  363.60] MEE073: yeah
[  363.34-  363.68] FEO070: yeah
[  365.94-  372.88] MEE073: yeah unless we unless we discover some sort of time warp thing or something
[  366.30-  389.00] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah yeah that is right yeah so maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading but put it under changes since the initial specification and say yeah we did not we decided the the time is too short for them
[  370.96-  373.54] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  372.80-  375.80] FEO070: yeah but that is definitely one thing we have just really
[  380.12-  382.48] MEE073: yeah yeah true yep
[  382.40-  382.70] FEO070: yeah
[  385.04-  386.24] MEE071: we did not think it was enough time
[  388.36-  390.00] MEE071: or we found they were a m more important
[  390.00-  391.36] MEE071: things to do with our time and
[  391.28-  391.72] FEO072: yes
[  392.96-  394.20] MEE071: to worry about
[  393.36-  398.42] FEO072: well we would prefer to concentrate on the main
[  404.96-  410.96] FEO072: and i think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
[  409.14-  409.48] MEE073: yeah
[  411.12-  416.20] MEE073: yeah this this and this or some of them are a bit later somewhere yeah we could even
[  412.52-  415.04] FEO072: m m meet these milestones yeah
[  415.32-  417.84] MEE071: yeah that is a great idea i should have a section probably
[  417.12-  419.38] FEO070: yeah we have a mute yeah
[  417.58-  419.92] FEO072: like yeah developer prototype gui we could t
[  417.94-  418.28] MEE073: yeah
[  419.68-  419.96] MEE073: yeah
[  420.00-  424.48] FEO072: in a yeah we manage that nicely yeah
[  420.46-  420.80] FEO070: yeah
[  421.32-  423.68] MEE073: oh
[  423.76-  426.00] MEE071: best file on target or something
[  425.60-  437.86] MEE073: yeah that is what is the question
[  426.08-  428.56] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah put it up in really good
[  428.00-  435.68] MEE071: well yeah yeah
[  430.80-  449.08] FEO070: y he he does not have to know exactly what it is done i mean yeah i am not i am not finished but
[  441.04-  445.94] MEE071: and so i have only got six days to do the topic segment because you have not used to
[  441.76-  442.52] FEO072: just say we can
[  444.54-  450.00] MEE073: i do not have any s p n l p as i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i miss do you i
[  449.50-  450.00] MEE071: yeah
[  452.12-  460.88] FEO072: and you can say yeah we are say we are still aiming for the development to be complete in the amount of rates or something
[  454.38-  455.74] MEE071: speaking characterization
[  457.48-  458.02] MEE071: jesus
[  460.16-  465.76] MEE071: speaking characterization is supposed to be done already yeah two days ago
[  460.56-  460.84] MEE073: yeah
[  462.38-  471.18] MEE073: oh really for one of those something that you want to change and delete from a list of expectations
[  463.74-  464.40] FEO072: whoa
[  472.98-  475.92] MEE071: give me a week and i will tell you the answer to the answer
[  473.94-  478.98] MEE073: yeah like should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document
[  474.84-  475.84] FEO072: i yeah i
[  479.00-  480.00] MEE071: maybe the speaking
[  480.00-  481.44] MEE071: characterization may get sliver
[  481.88-  495.24] FEO072: yeah that is right i i really want to do it i mean it is not it is not going to be difficult if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta data file that is going to be no work to it so it is definitely going to be something there
[  481.94-  485.88] MEE073: ok alright yeah i know yeah
[  483.22-  485.80] MEE071: probably we will not disappear we yeah
[  491.30-  493.66] MEE073: ok yeah true yeah
[  492.24-  493.32] MEE071: yep
[  495.34-  497.80] MEE071: yeah we will not make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
[  495.42-  496.40] MEE073: ok sounds good
[  496.04-  496.18] FEO070: t
[  499.20-  503.12] MEE071: but we might not you do not know it might not depends on how how it goes
[  501.30-  504.84] FEO072: yeah we might turn out easier than thought
[  508.60-  510.00] MEE071: atomic segmentation with
[  510.00-  522.98] MEE071: l c seg and textiles basically done it just needs to be done the c yeah tuned yeah a search through the parameters by its main or something and see what happens
[  513.62-  517.76] MEE073: ok tuned and it is fine
[  522.48-  522.72] MEE073: kay
[  526.60-  527.42] FEO072: yeah sounds good
[  530.14-  530.60] FEO072: oh
[  530.52-  530.70] MEE073: kay
[  534.30-  534.52] FEO070: oh
[  536.78-  540.00] FEO070: shall we see the stones sorry we should probably
[  537.74-  540.00] FEO072: we should probably sorry we should
[  540.00-  540.16] FEO070: is
[  540.00-  549.60] FEO072: we do know the responsibility of packages as well that is what he hinted that we should also indicate who who is responsible for what from now on
[  548.32-  557.68] MEE073: right well i could probably just copy that straight over the other one as well that is essentially the same as it was more detail specifically
[  552.40-  553.42] MEE071: yeah pretty much
[  557.64-  560.02] FEO072: well you could put you know yeah i do not know
[  567.92-  570.00] FEO070: yeah should we i do not know
[  570.00-  580.70] FEO070: do you think mike about our things that we have together should we i mean no yeah i mean we have it now but you brought it and you have together but what about them
[  575.04-  580.16] MEE073: let us put those apart yeah i think so yeah like yeah that would be very far right yeah exactly
[  582.48-  585.86] FEO070: the main disfluences should we see
[  583.52-  588.06] MEE073: oh well if we are skipping the audio one and then things are easier
[  587.76-  593.72] FEO070: yeah you just keep it together on the the paper there right now and just see what what
[  589.80-  599.14] MEE073: yeah yeah have you taken any more of a look at it have you taken any more of a look at it at the disciplines ok ok we could probably
[  595.64-  598.70] FEO070: no not the disfluences no
[  601.68-  611.48] MEE073: and no full of time to look at that before tomorrow we could just make it up like i will claim one you claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one
[  603.88-  606.94] FEO070: yeah yeah it might be yeah
[  606.76-  607.42] FEO072: so and
[  612.24-  612.48] FEO070: yeah
[  612.96-  614.00] MEE073: and we pick it up ok
[  614.42-  614.88] FEO070: something
[  614.96-  617.66] FEO072: have you managed any further on the search thing
[  617.80-  630.00] MEE073: i found finally today something that i can build it in and it i should have something for tomorrow i should at you know at least very least have a a gooey and a wire i will be wiring that
[  627.98-  628.28] FEO072: alright
[  629.20-  629.72] FEO072: that is nice
[  630.00-  639.82] MEE073: and hopefully tomorrow morning so i want to get something i want to see this i want to get it together have an image in my mind and i just want to see it on the thing and then give a nice screen shot so
[  636.12-  637.08] FEO072: yeah
[  639.40-  639.64] FEO070: yeah
[  642.16-  653.48] FEO070: yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more as well so i do not know if we send it in on the afternoon maybe i can add a few sentences to what i am done
[  649.52-  660.00] MEE073: well well well it does not really matter i mean you can write the sentences first as well i mean with the intention that this is done i mean and also
[  658.08-  659.20] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  658.88-  659.80] FEO070: that is done
[  660.00-  663.44] FEO070: is that yeah hopefully yeah
[  660.00-  668.00] MEE073: a some sometimes it is a bit of a motivating factor too i mean you write down the words and the ideas and it is oh ok we will do this something and it is just all falls together
[  666.24-  668.00] FEO070: yeah yeah we will see
[  668.24-  674.74] MEE071: how about the underlying data for it for the inverted file how has that come out then
[  674.06-  674.32] MEE073: oh
[  675.80-  690.00] FEO070: well i still like struggling with java stuff and yeah but work on it a thing i was wondering about that is i have not looked at it so much but if any
[  679.40-  679.72] MEE073: alright
[  679.82-  680.18] MEE071: yeah
[  681.44-  682.04] MEE071: kind of
[  690.00-  701.94] FEO070: can you guys know how we could do the like from the extract words that you did like also in in s extract time stamps or some sort of thing is it
[  700.70-  720.00] MEE071: easy yeah just yeah we just when he pulls up the segments part of that one of the f one of the attributes if you do get attributes call the method called get attributes it returns a list of attributes search through those and then you just you can that will tell you what attributes it has got and then you can leave it all
[  705.52-  705.84] FEO070: yeah
[  711.94-  712.40] FEO070: ok
[  718.84-  719.20] FEO070: ok
[  720.00-  735.34] MEE071: automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the time stamps so you just say get attribute and put i think it is i think the math is called get attribute and it is it is called start time and end time and that will tell you the start times and end times i think it would sense a double
[  729.80-  730.10] FEO070: ok
[  731.78-  732.12] FEO070: ok
[  734.04-  734.32] FEO070: ok
[  736.40-  736.74] FEO070: ok
[  741.00-  743.62] FEO070: yeah so now i could just put it in so
[  744.48-  750.00] MEE071: yeah that is on the the n the the non write elements the the the the
[  745.04-  746.06] FEO070: super or something yeah
[  748.44-  748.92] FEO070: what on the
[  750.00-  752.30] MEE071: the object is a non write element i think
[  752.26-  752.64] FEO070: ok
[  756.40-  757.74] MEE071: that is a t t
[  757.76-  759.62] FEO070: yeah i will take a look at
[  767.80-  772.64] FEO072: so is there did you have you made a another m browser is there something that i should
[  772.04-  780.00] MEE073: there is but i have not made a lot of changes to it so i might just delete what i have done and copy it in from yours cause i am sure
[  780.00-  810.00] MEE073: you have probably made some changes already oh no since friday i am sorry ok i thought you said th alright i see i thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were coming pixels on the weekend or something no yeah yeah so if you all other stuff out there that actually i am going to try and minimize the amount of changes i made to am browser anyways should not
[  782.20-  786.72] FEO072: not since you are not diagnosed no but at work the night i said no
[  795.06-  802.50] FEO072: no after the weekend weekend was out
[  810.00-  810.32] MEE073: it
[  811.64-  840.00] MEE073: should not be an issue actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as what else the other summaries do we want separate result panes for each of those or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are so that when they you know click on that it is going to go to the relevant thing like just if they check all three say topics summaries from a block have three different windows come up
[  837.44-  838.50] FEO072: yeah yeah
[  841.48-  843.60] MEE073: or three like sub sub pings sort of
[  842.12-  853.44] FEO072: well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up or is that a a second result pane or is there a w you know does the window get larger what is the second what do you say
[  850.38-  868.02] MEE073: what i thought what we sort of discussed last week was to have it so on the same window so it will be on the search window bottom half of the search window i know if we still want to keep it that way but that is that is what it is going to be working with so so it is just like you click those and it just loads up
[  864.64-  865.00] FEO072: yeah
[  868.48-  869.86] FEO072: yeah yeah
[  870.00-  882.32] MEE073: three or whatever it is one two or three depending on which ones you check and then so if we want to do it that way you know like it probably does not matter too much just try and think if there is going to be any other issues down the road depending on
[  872.08-  872.56] FEO072: yeah
[  880.10-  880.70] FEO072: yeah
[  882.40-  888.48] MEE071: well have th you confuse me do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types of results
[  888.12-  900.00] MEE073: no just just panes just result panes richard no no no no no no so so it is just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we want to search then we will you know they will
[  890.20-  895.28] MEE071: ok not not three different ok good right
[  895.04-  896.24] FEO070: pick a separate
[  897.70-  897.84] MEE071: yep
[  900.00-  909.14] MEE073: be two result panes so for one for topic twenty four i do not know not really tabs but then you can not see all of them at the same time and it is just like
[  901.32-  903.00] MEE071: yeah or tabs or
[  904.04-  906.84] FEO072: yeah i quite like the idea of tab in that case
[  907.56-  908.62] FEO070: all are all
[  908.56-  913.54] FEO072: but you would not want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result would you not
[  913.02-  917.84] MEE073: well it is no but the thing is if you are looking if you could check them both you want to see all the results
[  916.52-  921.68] FEO072: actually yeah especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting
[  918.38-  919.60] MEE071: yeah yeah it is three things
[  921.78-  930.00] MEE073: yeah exactly yeah so the summary and the topic and the transcript and so or we could just put them all into one
[  922.92-  925.58] FEO072: oh yeah yeah yeah that is true
[  930.00-  933.08] MEE073: result pane on that same window and just indicate
[  930.80-  934.92] FEO072: yeah i mean we could we could order them by meeting for example
[  934.92-  942.96] MEE073: yeah oh yeah i guess that was the other thing whether we want to have this reorder by columns and all that well that is a half ok it is a lot of
[  938.46-  946.60] FEO072: how to order them yeah well i mean if you know that is you even the second step the first question is do we want to order them how do we want to order them in the first place
[  946.52-  955.98] MEE073: yeah i think yeah probably by meeting makes most sense i mean essentially they are temp you know in time order so you know that kinda makes most sense
[  950.34-  950.82] FEO072: yeah
[  957.24-  958.42] FEO072: yeah maybe we should do that
[  957.66-  958.28] MEE073: least
[  959.60-  960.00] MEE073: yeah
[  960.00-  965.84] MEE073: yeah should be an easy m no i do not know i am sure should be for a reason i guess
[  982.04-  984.32] FEO072: yeah why do not you just
[  985.44-  986.38] FEO072: color code those
[  987.48-  987.76] MEE073: yeah
[  987.96-  990.00] FEO072: the results to sort of different colors
[  988.88-  990.00] MEE073: think you sometimes in a
[  990.00- 1015.82] MEE073: case like that like a run across in other languages just that it is hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it is put into like a list box or something it is hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever and then if we are highlighting something in the transcript window it may be difficult to get that information back once it is just in a list box an item in a list box so let us let us yeah whereas if it is coming from
[ 1013.48- 1014.28] FEO072: no but if you
[ 1015.60- 1020.00] FEO072: if you if you do it straight from you know you get you get the result and then there is this
[ 1020.00- 1029.32] FEO072: if statement saying just straight on the l you know rock bottom le level saying if th if you found a segment then color it print it in red or whatever
[ 1026.26- 1026.52] MEE073: yeah
[ 1027.72- 1028.00] MEE073: right
[ 1029.22- 1031.08] MEE073: yeah yeah it is just
[ 1030.84- 1031.70] FEO072: as opposed to
[ 1032.64- 1050.00] MEE073: yeah yeah it is just like from past experience of there is goofy little things that happen and it just does not let you say certain things and it is just kinda trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window so if you want to go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic or highlight the
[ 1038.84- 1039.24] FEO072: oh
[ 1041.38- 1043.30] FEO072: oh well have a look
[ 1050.00- 1050.86] FEO072: oh
[ 1050.00- 1058.78] MEE073: at that point that is sort of where it starts getting a little bit tricky cause you are working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is and
[ 1053.36- 1054.52] FEO072: yeah yeah i can imagine
[ 1058.78- 1060.12] FEO072: oh oh i see yeah
[ 1060.24- 1070.60] MEE073: so there are ways around it but you know whether i will be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah i know or delegates or whatever that is that so anyway
[ 1063.60- 1065.44] FEO072: y you have to use actions
[ 1069.56- 1075.84] FEO072: yeah i mean at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window does not it
[ 1075.72- 1076.56] MEE073: right that is right
[ 1077.16- 1077.66] FEO072: so
[ 1078.52- 1080.00] MEE073: i think he was saying that as long as we
[ 1080.00- 1101.48] MEE073: implement that interface it should work with anything that we do like highlighting or you know i think that was who was saying that was not jonathan saying something about that i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window we should be able to have that highlighting open
[ 1090.12- 1091.44] FEO072: what do you mean it should work with anything
[ 1102.92- 1103.32] MEE073: anyways
[ 1104.98- 1105.24] MEE073: ok
[ 1105.72- 1110.00] FEO072: yeah i mean the whole the what fills the transcription
[ 1110.00- 1117.10] FEO072: box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pane made by knight so i am not sure what it is called now i do not know
[ 1114.86- 1115.40] MEE073: ok
[ 1119.52- 1120.92] FEO072: or something more
[ 1122.14- 1135.92] FEO072: no i do not know what it is called and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well as i said you know if you if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically so maybe it comes with something clever as well
[ 1128.52- 1130.12] MEE073: ok ok alright
[ 1132.98- 1133.34] MEE073: ok
[ 1134.76- 1139.68] MEE073: ok maybe i should maybe i should use that as well you know yeah ok
[ 1138.12- 1138.56] FEO072: yeah
[ 1139.36- 1140.00] MEE071: it is well with a nice
[ 1140.00- 1142.24] MEE071: text pane or something is it
[ 1141.48- 1145.06] FEO072: no i am sure there is not pain in it no
[ 1146.36- 1157.20] FEO072: i do not know text text yeah i do not know that might yeah non texting is not it yeah why well it is non anyway no
[ 1146.92- 1149.56] MEE071: text area i think
[ 1150.52- 1150.80] MEE073: yeah
[ 1151.40- 1153.64] MEE071: nomin text line most of the things are called normal yeah
[ 1154.04- 1155.20] MEE073: no wire
[ 1155.32- 1164.24] MEE071: nite object model i think night object model that is what they are going to do
[ 1157.04- 1158.72] MEE073: ok that makes sense
[ 1159.12- 1159.74] FEO070: what
[ 1165.40- 1166.82] FEO070: ok
[ 1178.68- 1179.56] MEE071: with the
[ 1181.30- 1196.76] MEE071: the removing the displeancies have you done anything with that yet cause i was wondering how we going to write it back to h t m l i mean x m l if we take if we did the processing
[ 1186.24- 1186.46] MEE073: yeah
[ 1186.46- 1187.18] FEO070: right
[ 1198.28- 1199.72] MEE071: writing it back to x m l
[ 1200.00- 1213.40] MEE073: f i thought we were just going to have that as words like not e th not as x m l just sort of as a was that what was that though well transcript you said oh no transcript no cause then we need all the other data if we want to keep it a transcript yeah
[ 1201.60- 1201.90] MEE071: tis
[ 1205.76- 1206.92] MEE071: as a block of text
[ 1208.20- 1208.72] MEE071: text file
[ 1213.98- 1222.32] MEE071: you will very much limit what you can do with it if it is not in x m l format that is really there is some bizarre method that puts things back into x m l format
[ 1214.72- 1215.02] MEE073: yeah
[ 1216.32- 1217.38] FEO070: yeah that is true yeah
[ 1216.36- 1218.16] MEE073: yeah that is true yeah point
[ 1221.44- 1228.56] FEO072: why do why do we want it in x m l there i mean i thought we would we just selectively selectively write the x m l that we have got
[ 1230.28- 1230.70] MEE071: what
[ 1231.12- 1232.86] FEO072: so as as opposed to
[ 1231.40- 1231.96] FEO070: oh yeah
[ 1233.12- 1238.08] MEE071: oh select what we want just take bits of the x m l take only only take certain segments
[ 1235.76- 1236.12] FEO072: yeah
[ 1237.20- 1251.18] FEO072: yeah only only print out certain certain segments the segments that we want just selectively at the moment it prints out all of them we will just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print segments not not store it at all whatsoever
[ 1237.24- 1238.26] FEO070: yeah we
[ 1243.84- 1249.64] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah certain segments ok yeah yeah alright
[ 1245.10- 1245.36] FEO070: yeah
[ 1248.04- 1248.56] FEO070: yeah
[ 1251.24- 1252.36] MEE071: ok that
[ 1252.52- 1260.00] MEE073: oh yeah ok then that is then that is not good yeah i know that is sort of what we were thinking before actually but this makes work
[ 1252.88- 1255.24] FEO070: yeah that is what that is where i think we like
[ 1253.28- 1253.76] FEO072: yeah
[ 1254.58- 1256.32] MEE071: it says something different there that is what
[ 1256.50- 1256.84] FEO070: ok
[ 1257.24- 1257.88] FEO072: oh right
[ 1257.88- 1260.00] MEE071: and written to a written to a file and we go
[ 1260.00- 1266.24] MEE071: so whatever will be done but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no like cause you can do things on word level so yeah that is fine
[ 1260.00- 1260.32] MEE073: sense
[ 1261.76- 1262.08] MEE073: yeah
[ 1266.24- 1269.88] MEE073: yeah if we are going to do the x m l then fine that is a problem we should do
[ 1268.48- 1268.90] MEE071: yeah
[ 1268.96- 1271.48] FEO070: i mean we are not really well i mean
[ 1272.92- 1275.72] FEO070: we are not going to do much more than just look at the
[ 1277.16- 1284.50] FEO070: the room like the the textbook room with the displeases cause we are not going to search it and we are not going to like listen to it
[ 1285.46- 1285.74] FEO072: yeah
[ 1286.44- 1288.16] FEO070: since we are not doing the audio thing
[ 1289.52- 1289.88] MEE071: yeah
[ 1290.00- 1295.04] FEO070: so i guess just displaying it is alright but yeah yeah yeah yeah
[ 1290.48- 1291.02] FEO072: so what
[ 1293.16- 1295.08] MEE071: this one is touch yeah
[ 1293.44- 1294.34] MEE073: as text yeah
[ 1294.04- 1296.94] FEO072: yeah yeah you do not really need to do much more with it yeah that is right
[ 1296.06- 1296.34] FEO070: no
[ 1296.60- 1297.46] MEE071: yeah but it will
[ 1297.04- 1304.72] MEE073: but the thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take this fluencies out and just c you know create a text file take the discluency out of the text file and yeah
[ 1303.00- 1309.94] MEE071: it will just be a blurb like a summary it will not look like it will not say speaker x says this speaker y says that speaker z says this
[ 1309.66- 1316.32] MEE073: unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file yeah that is true
[ 1312.40- 1317.24] MEE071: yeah then it will look ugly probably cause it will look just black and white unless you want to start a file
[ 1316.76- 1320.00] FEO070: it is probably best in two as you said like just
[ 1319.30- 1320.00] FEO072: i do not think
[ 1320.00- 1323.26] FEO070: think it is going to take long to to produce anyway it is just another
[ 1320.00- 1331.12] FEO072: think it is going to take long to to produce anyway it is just another i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it is just words and to print all of them out selectively
[ 1321.64- 1323.82] MEE071: no i do i do not think that is i do not think that is true
[ 1323.80- 1324.12] MEE073: yeah
[ 1332.36- 1333.76] MEE071: it does not want to fly anyway does not it so
[ 1334.08- 1334.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 1335.10- 1338.60] MEE071: so then it just goes through and says that this word equals that imprint
[ 1335.24- 1335.44] MEE073: yeah
[ 1339.32- 1339.50] FEO070: yeah
[ 1339.48- 1339.74] FEO072: yeah
[ 1341.84- 1343.20] MEE071: just a bunch of istatness
[ 1344.16- 1350.00] FEO072: you could nearly do it together with with the the transcription with the original transcription having run power
[ 1344.28- 1344.44] MEE073: yeah
[ 1350.00- 1350.16] FEO072: well
[ 1351.86- 1362.28] FEO072: so if a certain you know if it is a proper word print it on both both panes and if it is not proper word then print it only on one but i mean that is that is you know fancy but
[ 1361.80- 1362.02] MEE073: yeah
[ 1364.92- 1365.54] FEO072: but
[ 1365.00- 1371.28] MEE071: yeah you probably could actually there is probably that is probably not that more difficult you are just doing fatten the code out a bit it would be the same thing
[ 1367.24- 1367.70] FEO072: yeah
[ 1369.52- 1371.36] FEO072: yeah but then
[ 1372.52- 1380.00] FEO072: you know the the the good way of doing it not together is that you if someone does not want to look at the the
[ 1380.00- 1384.08] FEO072: the the you know the chop file then you do not ever have to produce it
[ 1383.00- 1385.08] MEE071: ok yep exactly
[ 1386.00- 1401.40] FEO072: so but i mean you can you know you can write we can write something like we will try and do it on the fly and and observe if if that going to is going to take too long if it is going to take too long well think about writing it to a file and doing it off line
[ 1400.16- 1406.96] MEE071: should not i it is just they will just be ifs diamonds are not they do not have fast ifs diamonds it is low residual stipends
[ 1403.00- 1403.82] FEO072: yeah
[ 1403.04- 1410.00] MEE073: yeah burp i was just thinking as well i mean we could probably even use like x s l t to kinda just transform it and
[ 1410.00- 1439.96] MEE073: you know flip it into just transforms like a style sheet x m l style sheet and then it is kinda like there is usually things built in to well it should be built into java i mean to process x m l into like in j just creates whatever file it is going to be in i dunno it has been a few couple of years since i have looked at anything like this but that might even be an easier way and then that way we could even pre process that beforehand i do not know d well we do not want to have to do that right although i
[ 1412.46- 1412.84] MEE071: what is that
[ 1416.84- 1417.38] FEO072: alright
[ 1439.34- 1440.00] MEE071: oh we will not know
[ 1440.00- 1451.36] MEE071: have to put it in take put it back into x m l java even trying to read it in x m l with java was complicated enough i gave up to it and that completely devoted back to n knight stuff cause it was much much much easier
[ 1440.00- 1442.16] MEE073: on the play it is to be click proof
[ 1445.32- 1449.16] MEE073: oh really ok yeah
[ 1451.46- 1451.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 1452.84- 1459.68] MEE071: so we can do it with knight stuff do it with knight stuff i think i mean as it can always java and trying to do j it was just so complicated it was really
[ 1454.44- 1456.00] MEE073: yeah ok yeah
[ 1459.00- 1461.92] MEE073: ok yeah
[ 1461.80- 1470.00] MEE071: you can not believe it you have to d start defining object models like the knight thing and getting all bizarre weird things
[ 1465.52- 1467.32] MEE073: ok you are serious
[ 1468.96- 1469.46] MEE073: sincere
[ 1470.00- 1470.92] MEE071: do not like to
[ 1471.68- 1498.28] MEE073: actually i was thinking i might try and talk to who is it jonathan and gene like just to see what they what system they use to develop this stuff cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kinda like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system you know at a higher level rather than kinda you know playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that it would be nice to just sorta see what they are doing so i might try and contact them see if there is i dunno
[ 1475.50- 1476.08] FEO072: ok
[ 1499.64- 1500.00] MEE073: any other
[ 1500.00- 1505.42] MEE073: hints they could give us just to get things i do not know moving at a higher level i guess
[ 1506.88- 1511.36] MEE073: it seems to be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would
[ 1513.04- 1517.60] MEE073: cause it just seemed like a little tinkering here and there and just adding a couple of things and
[ 1518.80- 1521.04] FEO072: that is what programming is all about i am afraid
[ 1518.88- 1519.28] MEE073: that is not
[ 1518.90- 1519.08] MEE071: yeah
[ 1520.76- 1530.00] MEE073: y no no it should not be no it should be higher level it should not be conceptual and you know coming up with the the brilliant ideas and then just you know
[ 1530.00- 1538.12] MEE073: bringing those to reality yeah
[ 1531.60- 1534.32] FEO072: yeah maybe for higher people
[ 1538.56- 1540.32] FEO070: ok
[ 1538.96- 1539.68] FEO072: well i mean
[ 1540.88- 1555.26] FEO072: yeah why do not you put both both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you will have a look at both or something if you want to do it i i personally do not want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment i want to do it superficially
[ 1551.52- 1551.82] MEE073: yeah
[ 1558.64- 1560.00] MEE073: like the thing that i was thinking there as well
[ 1560.00- 1577.48] MEE073: all this once it is done for a f you know one meeting it is done and it is there it is a file text file or x m l or whatever it is but yeah just i dunno it just it does not make any difference really either way to me it is like if it is fast enough on the fly then sure that is about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it is fast enough
[ 1563.14- 1563.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 1578.06- 1578.48] FEO072: yeah
[ 1578.68- 1579.40] MEE071: as better away
[ 1578.82- 1578.94] MEE073: but
[ 1579.56- 1586.48] MEE073: especially with java and all those other crap and just if it is loading the file and doing all the rest and processing and yeah
[ 1586.44- 1587.96] FEO072: well it has already loaded it anyway
[ 1588.08- 1588.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 1589.08- 1590.00] MEE071: yeah it is always it is
[ 1590.00- 1590.84] MEE071: after a side of it
[ 1592.36- 1594.94] MEE071: it is just a it is just a for loop really it is really fine yeah
[ 1594.16- 1595.08] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 1594.24- 1598.70] MEE073: we will run out of memory
[ 1596.80- 1597.24] MEE071: yeah
[ 1600.22- 1600.66] MEE073: yeah
[ 1603.86- 1607.30] FEO072: so shall we all write a letter or two about future work as well
[ 1608.92- 1611.52] MEE071: yeah i included a feature work in my own section but
[ 1609.14- 1609.96] FEO072: yeah
[ 1611.80- 1612.12] FEO072: alright
[ 1611.80- 1612.14] MEE073: yeah
[ 1612.82- 1617.76] MEE071: i just said i said what i have done so far and what i am going to do and some pr some issues yeah
[ 1615.22- 1616.74] FEO072: yeah well maybe you could
[ 1617.26- 1619.22] MEE073: right yeah i think so
[ 1618.00- 1619.32] FEO072: maybe you could split that up and
[ 1620.54- 1623.82] MEE073: oh like into each yeah
[ 1622.74- 1623.68] MEE071: i think you lose the
[ 1622.78- 1626.28] FEO072: yeah like here is what we have done already and then you know down here
[ 1625.60- 1633.80] MEE071: you might lose a bit of continuity if you do that though that is what i was thinking that is sometimes it is easier to have the top in its own intersections if you see i mean so you talk about speaker characters and see what i mean
[ 1626.32- 1626.68] FEO070: yeah
[ 1631.46- 1632.10] MEE073: yeah i g
[ 1632.72- 1633.36] FEO072: yeah
[ 1633.26- 1642.04] MEE073: i think that does make sense but maybe at the end maybe just a a point form of you know things that we are still working on things that we do yeah yeah
[ 1639.18- 1639.56] FEO072: maybe
[ 1639.84- 1650.00] MEE071: golds or something something bullet p bullet bullet points yeah because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing here if they are not together you lose a lot of the continuity
[ 1641.06- 1643.96] FEO072: yeah that is right yeah yeah maybe maybe
[ 1643.60- 1643.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 1647.12- 1648.02] MEE073: yeah i know what you mean
[ 1649.30- 1650.00] FEO072: yeah maybe
[ 1650.00- 1651.14] FEO072: oh yeah
[ 1650.00- 1650.60] MEE071: right
[ 1650.00- 1652.24] MEE073: yeah it is ok it is simple
[ 1681.12- 1682.10] MEE073: so
[ 1683.32- 1690.92] FEO072: sounds good anything else anyone wants to talk about we all have sleep are we
[ 1685.22- 1686.76] MEE071: so yeah
[ 1693.38- 1693.78] FEO070: yeah
[ 1693.64- 1694.26] FEO072: burnt out
[ 1697.26- 1710.00] FEO072: there are one maybe asleep so we are all still writing our some
[ 1698.12- 1705.56] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 1700.88- 1705.36] FEO070: yeah maybe a sleep
[ 1701.52- 1701.72] MEE071: yeah
[ 1710.00- 1712.28] FEO072: are you sending them to you you send it on to people
[ 1711.64- 1727.28] MEE073: or or she will just take she can take it from there does not matter or do you want to or no no ok i c i can yeah sure if you want to send them to me that is fine yeah ok actually no no actually that is a good idea i will take one quick look over try and get it as good as i think that we can
[ 1715.34- 1716.16] FEO072: how kind
[ 1716.88- 1717.90] FEO070: what
[ 1720.28- 1723.56] FEO070: i do not know it does not matter to me either but
[ 1726.90- 1730.68] FEO070: yeah i mean it is good yeah
[ 1727.04- 1727.44] FEO072: yeah
[ 1727.42- 1729.00] MEE071: you stick it together she will shine it
[ 1729.42- 1729.72] MEE073: ok
[ 1729.64- 1736.52] FEO072: yeah and then send it on to us so that we can nod
[ 1733.04- 1740.00] FEO070: yeah anchoring back any like things that i thought was
[ 1733.10- 1733.54] MEE071: yeah
[ 1734.76- 1736.28] MEE073: you really have a female idea
[ 1736.48- 1736.68] MEE071: yeah
[ 1740.00- 1747.04] FEO070: roll in the english or whatever like no whatever
[ 1741.70- 1742.08] MEE071: yeah
[ 1741.84- 1750.22] MEE073: yeah yeah we are changing dialog back l o j ok
[ 1744.86- 1754.52] FEO072: ok sounds good i have not used my pen
[ 1745.10- 1746.68] MEE071: yeah
[ 1750.66- 1750.96] FEO070: yeah
[ 1752.30- 1752.66] MEE073: oh
[ 1752.84- 1763.52] FEO070: well i said i would like four lines yeah i am twelve thirty margul with
[ 1754.78- 1755.80] MEE073: i have
[ 1759.32- 1759.96] MEE073: ok
[ 1763.84- 1765.44] MEE073: oh oh my
[ 1764.44- 1767.00] MEE071: oh
[ 1765.16- 1765.68] FEO070: c
[ 1765.68- 1766.36] FEO072: oh god
[ 1769.06- 1770.00] MEE073: oh
[ 1770.00- 1771.78] MEE073: curturtle it is more normal
[ 1771.16- 1773.56] FEO070: yeah
[ 1777.96- 1781.16] FEO072: yeah
[ 1782.72- 1786.60] MEE071: trop days are right yeah that was a little idea let us see

============================================================
SESSION: EN2002c
============================================================

[   20.66-   27.56] MEE071: oops does it squeezing like that yeah
[   37.78-   38.46] MEE071: ok
[   46.44-   46.72] MEE071: right
[   47.02-   51.52] MEE073: do you have any comments
[   53.26-   56.56] FEO072: did we get seven out of time for york
[   54.96-   59.38] MEE071: yeah it is going to
[   61.32-   62.04] MEE073: oh
[   64.28-   65.32] MEE071: that is ok
[   64.56-   65.24] MEE073: that is good
[   67.08-   67.30] MEE071: sure
[   67.12-   68.22] MEE073: right
[   67.58-   67.92] FEO072: ok
[   91.88-   93.52] MEE071: do i just said the same thing as you just said to his
[   93.86-   94.20] MEE073: yeah
[   98.38-   99.28] FEO072: yep
[  103.84-  103.98] MEE073: kay
[  103.98-  105.16] MEE071: so how are we getting along
[  107.14-  107.60] FEO072: oh man
[  107.68-  120.00] MEE073: one thing that i was wondering is there a standard control that you use to connect the different things like you are in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever
[  120.00-  127.12] MEE073: is there a particular type of control that like is there one of these n x t or sorry knight controls i know i am on a
[  125.08-  148.40] FEO072: i think there is just because the the topic box and all this is is based on what was it called non you know night text area or something in text area as all those it has some sort of piloting stuff there so you should probably look at the
[  140.86-  141.40] MEE073: ok
[  155.36-  157.32] FEO072: i am not sure if it is inbuilt though to be honest
[  157.92-  173.38] MEE073: you have not had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing like other topics or well we are going to do one for speaker i guess and all the rest right right well ok when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
[  166.68-  167.86] FEO072: what
[  173.38-  180.00] MEE071: that i wanted to talk about that actually the speaker the data processing is fine but i would not particularly want to do the
[  180.00-  210.00] MEE071: the gui for it no not really if some if you want to do that n n tell me how you want data presented how cause do you want me to tell you because at moment re is i have created two classes one that represents speakers one that represents meetings and meet and information about both is contained within each object so and n y r it writes objects and objects contain all information about meetings and speakers so me who speaker
[  182.50-  188.68] FEO072: you do not ok ok yeah i was thinking about i was going about actually
[  186.70-  186.88] MEE073: yeah
[  190.52-  190.92] FEO072: yeah
[  210.00-  235.32] MEE071: consider at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the averages are contained with the speakers so there is two separate classes do you see what i mean and they are they are two different objects and you can really call they can write the writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they those returned objects have all the information that they need and then you can call methods to return whatever you want or everything but that is why i wanted to know how what is the easiest way to have the data
[  216.98-  218.64] FEO072: ok yeah so
[  229.96-  232.68] FEO072: ok yeah i see what you mean i think
[  235.20-  240.00] FEO072: so i have you already calculated all this data what are you supposed to say that
[  238.92-  240.00] MEE071: yeah that is basically all
[  240.00-  240.42] FEO072: oh right
[  240.00-  269.60] MEE071: populate the data and all stored as objects so dot object files which means if you just re call the and it will nod the structure and call the load thing and call it there and you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever you want to do with it and then or just call them one at a time to populate a window but that is what i wanted to how you how what format do you want the data to come back in cause it can come back as almost anything yeah well it is easiest to display the data
[  241.42-  241.62] MEE073: yeah
[  244.88-  245.36] FEO072: oh right
[  245.20-  245.52] MEE073: ok
[  253.64-  253.88] MEE073: ok
[  264.56-  267.36] FEO072: yeah right what we can make sure it come back as
[  264.60-  264.90] MEE073: yeah
[  268.08-  270.00] MEE073: actually it is to display that might also help like
[  269.12-  269.72] FEO072: so we will be
[  270.00-  289.72] MEE073: when he was talking about like have an architecture that things are going to plug into i mean so that things are all modular i mean it would be good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we are doing or what else we are doing actually even the searches or whatever you know just any sort of thing i mean search results if they are all in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or a listed properties vector you know
[  273.14-  273.48] MEE071: yeah
[  280.20-  280.80] MEE071: yeah
[  282.40-  283.20] MEE071: yeah you could you could
[  286.72-  300.00] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah so so i can have it so that it returns you a as at the moment the main data structures are hash table
[  300.00-  330.00] MEE071: s for the meetings that say it has got one that says percent is called percent talk one is percent noise and one is percent participation do you see what i mean so and then has got inside has got a link has got a has got the speaker is name and then has got their percentage for that thing so can e her come back as a you can have the hash table or you can have returned as a vector and will say noise is just a strings noise x percent will say a vector that is called i do not know whatever but you
[  316.24-  316.96] FEO072: oh yeah
[  330.00-  343.12] MEE071: can either have it you can either have a you could have a like an embedded a l a vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever what the what the easiest thing to do how how you want to display it
[  337.44-  338.48] MEE073: oh
[  338.62-  343.96] FEO072: oh yeah you get me and i can do it i mean i mean
[  340.52-  347.88] MEE073: how you want to display yeah it is just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest all the way around right
[  346.40-  348.36] MEE071: yeah yeah exactly
[  348.64-  357.06] FEO072: so what we will whenever we open a window for one speaker
[  355.18-  355.48] MEE071: yeah
[  359.62-  360.00] MEE071: see that is
[  360.00-  363.16] MEE071: ok how do we can i look at that again
[  365.16-  390.00] MEE071: it is if it is in that format it is speaker speaker is the controlling thing not yeah yeah ok yeah yeah yeah so all of this all that is calculated as well still the speaker objects yeah that is that is easy something quite amusing actually the the influences are i lived in germany for six months do not know if that had any effect expect too
[  368.52-  370.78] FEO072: yeah right pretty much all that is all
[  373.36-  375.60] FEO072: yeah yeah definitely
[  381.48-  381.90] FEO072: oh is it
[  389.00-  390.00] MEE073: oh yeah
[  390.00-  404.28] MEE071: i have time talking to brits and i always get some bizarre things so and then th all that is calculated as well we will have to do is get the dialog out so i do not think that will be difficult
[  390.00-  394.98] MEE073: last time talking to brits and i always got some bizarre things i do not know where do these people go
[  414.34-  419.72] MEE071: so then does this how does is how is this box populated is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted
[  421.22-  427.48] FEO072: the one present although we could do we could do the one highlighted i suppose
[  422.36-  423.40] MEE071: the one present method
[  429.50-  450.00] MEE071: cause at the moment i am using there is there are methods that say for the for i using for other talk stars processes and it says like get get talk time and you and you text a name so that could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that and that would populate that which would be an easy thing to do and the same for that
[  450.00-  471.62] FEO072: would that would be implementing what he said that you want to see per topic you want to see which one spoken most sort of thing like that so you could you could zap through these topics meetings sorry and and it would come up with how much they are spoken you can pick the one that books most so do you want to do that then
[  450.00-  450.44] MEE071: i think
[  462.00-  463.90] MEE071: meetings yeah yeah
[  468.34-  470.44] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah that will be easy as well yeah
[  472.00-  480.00] MEE071: yeah ok so i will w i will just leave in lots of methods that is that will just return one number at a time that will be the easiest way to do yeah
[  477.16-  480.00] FEO072: yeah definitely
[  480.00-  482.00] MEE071: ok yeah that is fine
[  481.66-  486.70] FEO072: so yeah random things like just return talking time and
[  485.64-  489.48] MEE071: yeah get talk done i think it is called a little something that i think
[  488.68-  490.04] FEO072: yeah good
[  491.78-  492.32] FEO072: yeah i mean
[  492.24-  500.04] MEE073: so each time you are going straight to the x m l files for for the information or right oh i see ok i see ok
[  495.72-  510.00] MEE071: no it is stored as an object file it prices a whole lot offline it stores it as an object and then they are much much smaller they are only like a one without one k yeah just all pre processed and then it is just each object has got a return bunch of return methods you
[  502.58-  510.00] MEE073: right ok so that is all just pre processed just pre processed ok ok ok
[  510.00-  528.78] MEE071: have to recreate the object it is called a load method so what you do is you call a null constructor cause if you call the proper constructor for each meeting it goes off and does all the processing and stores its own object and then if you call a null constructor then you put a call load and you can call load on like l one or all of them or anything like that go to a list
[  510.00-  513.44] MEE073: right ok as well
[  519.60-  520.44] MEE073: yeah right
[  526.48-  537.04] MEE073: right is this is it for the entire corpus or is it just like individual ones like one f one object for ok that is nice oh each meeting ok ok
[  531.32-  531.46] MEE071: yeah
[  533.96-  539.40] MEE071: one object for each meeting yeah or they yeah yeah
[  539.18-  540.00] MEE073: i wonder if that would be useful for
[  540.00-  544.12] MEE073: where some of the other stuff we are doing well
[  543.24-  551.44] MEE071: yeah it just tell it tells you who participated at the moment it tells you who participated and the amounts they participated in percentages and in time as well
[  548.72-  549.12] MEE073: right ok
[  551.28-  558.28] FEO072: can you put in there what topic we are spoken about as well then i could use that for the for the topic pop up in the
[  553.92-  555.74] MEE071: yeah yeah that would be pretty easy yeah
[  555.04-  555.24] MEE073: yeah
[  558.44-  558.72] MEE073: alright
[  559.04-  564.36] MEE071: yeah there will be too difficult but that would be that would cause a problem with anything that was not annotated for topics
[  560.76-  561.12] FEO072: ok
[  565.40-  566.08] FEO072: that was not well
[  566.08-  570.00] MEE073: or just return an all or a blank or a blank string or something
[  567.52-  570.00] MEE071: yeah no topic specified idea will have a default yeah
[  570.00-  577.26] MEE071: well there are some there are some deeper hard knowns actually a lot of people do not give the range and all the stuff but
[  570.00-  571.08] MEE073: yeah
[  571.46-  571.72] FEO072: yeah
[  574.34-  574.58] MEE073: yeah
[  575.92-  576.14] MEE073: right
[  576.64-  587.90] FEO072: yeah because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics you have the option of pop popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic so
[  586.84-  587.20] MEE071: yeah
[  588.62-  599.96] MEE071: ok right yeah that would be a problem and then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects cause that is the thing these these are so small that you can load each w all of the whole lot up and do a search over the whole lot to find who parses back in what no
[  598.80-  599.04] FEO072: yeah
[  599.48-  599.96] MEE073: yeah
[  600.00-  603.20] MEE071: problem or what topics were in what so it does not crash the thing
[  600.00-  602.58] MEE073: problem right ok ok ok
[  600.56-  600.82] FEO072: yeah
[  603.66-  612.54] FEO072: so how how would you how would you calculate that would you do the summarization as you populate it you know to see yeah for the
[  610.28-  615.48] MEE071: what the global statistics come straight off of that do not they cause they are just for the meter meet the the
[  615.52-  622.10] FEO072: oh right so oh so that that is all sto stored together oh right ok ok
[  618.22-  622.24] MEE071: the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that stuff
[  625.64-  625.96] MEE071: no
[  625.68-  630.00] FEO072: sounds good so have you done these yet the the
[  628.58-  630.00] MEE071: no no but i do not think that we do not have to
[  630.00-  632.60] FEO072: we just got to decide on what we want to
[  630.00-  630.16] MEE071: what
[  632.88-  638.06] MEE071: what we want yeah i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
[  635.28-  645.94] FEO072: yeah i do not think yeah so it is all all usable now can i do it tonight
[  642.80-  654.12] MEE071: no design the game first and because if the problem is if you change the classes it the object is serial numbers change and you can not reload the object so all the processing has to be done over again and i have not quite finished a bit so
[  656.04-  660.00] MEE071: it would become out of sync and get a bit funny if i gave
[  660.00-  672.92] MEE071: you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it and then i changed it and run the thing again you would not ever be able to load the objects back up so and you would have to and then you would have multiple copies of objects to all over place and you get it is really happy
[  666.66-  667.22] FEO072: oh i see
[  667.20-  667.36] MEE073: yeah
[  672.24-  677.04] FEO072: yeah well let me know when when it is sort of usable because
[  676.36-  688.60] MEE071: but if you can if you want to make the picture you can do that without anything like that presumably just the internal that yeah the text if that does not take that well ok
[  681.38-  687.84] FEO072: what do you mean a picture do you mean just the yeah but it is not going to take quite a while i mean it is m yeah
[  684.52-  684.74] MEE073: just
[  690.74-  699.24] MEE071: right well it will not take very long to get it all finished right now but i i need i will need to have done all of this stuff too first cause otherwise the objects will not be the same
[  702.72-  706.82] FEO072: sounds good so where is that is that stored in the
[  706.56-  707.92] MEE071: no it is on my home direction
[  708.98-  711.36] FEO072: on your home directory not in the ok
[  710.14-  714.34] MEE071: oh my home it is going to be well it is finished up with a glow on my overgate computer
[  711.64-  711.68] MEE073: yeah
[  713.06-  713.22] FEO072: yep
[  714.30-  720.00] MEE073: yeah actually i can upload my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your phone just to load
[  714.68-  715.20] FEO072: soffage
[  720.00-  725.92] MEE073: this one instead of the the default so that is it two lines to go so
[  721.92-  722.24] FEO072: alright
[  725.14-  733.20] FEO072: yeah well are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you want to do with that if you want to change my code
[  730.70-  731.64] MEE073: what do you mean
[  733.36-  736.98] MEE073: well yeah just the one thing that is like the action for loading up the search thing
[  735.52-  741.20] FEO072: you yeah but are you do you want to change that m the original m browser file then or yeah
[  740.58-  746.92] MEE073: yeah well your version yeah yeah no i did it in my directory just just doing it yeah
[  742.88-  743.92] FEO072: have you done that now or
[  745.68-  748.32] FEO072: oh ok so not the actual one but a copy of it
[  750.00-  759.32] MEE073: i have a copy yes i am yeah but i will yeah i was going to update that one just yeah it just makes sense that then you then you can pass it right
[  751.46-  753.04] FEO072: ok yeah no just
[  756.90-  767.84] FEO072: well just just tell me when because i usually i usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if if the one in the share item has changed ok
[  761.14-  763.10] MEE073: right yeah and then update yeah
[  764.98-  771.02] MEE073: yeah yeah i have not i have not made any changes to it yeah so yeah yeah i will just make that one i will let you know
[  772.08-  772.84] FEO072: yeah yeah
[  773.12-  780.00] MEE073: cause yeah like i say two lines of code ok that is so nice and then you can play
[  775.24-  775.50] FEO072: yeah
[  778.12-  778.40] FEO072: cool
[  780.00-  786.26] MEE073: there is not much to the end of it have to get better results like better presented
[  785.80-  789.92] FEO072: so is that what you are working on now then to to rip to present results nicer or
[  788.18-  810.00] MEE073: yeah yeah and just to wire in the the topics and do the summaries so well also yeah like that that as well so yeah so you just want to find out what kind of objects those were that for the other ones so it goes in and
[  797.26-  799.16] FEO072: you mean the h highlighting stuff or
[  810.00-  813.04] MEE073: i have not stopped because i was i do not
[  811.60-  834.08] FEO072: yeah actually for for an end text area whatever it is they they define some h handy highlights on that so you have got different different highlights you have got just look at the the what they wrote about it they have got like user highlights selection highlights time highlights and
[  823.26-  823.60] MEE073: yeah
[  835.64-  836.48] FEO072: something else
[  838.66-  840.00] FEO072: so you can quite easily
[  840.00-  846.16] FEO072: if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something you know something like that
[  845.20-  845.68] MEE073: ok
[  847.80-  848.16] MEE073: alright
[  849.04-  854.16] FEO072: that is the way i did it to to highlight to cross highlight between topic and and and transcripts
[  850.62-  850.96] MEE073: ok
[  855.92-  856.80] MEE073: ok sounds good
[  856.46-  856.84] FEO072: so that is good
[  858.92-  870.00] MEE073: ok there is a few more things to do with that and then once we know it gets the the index then that is going to be kind of fun like i am just wondering if you had to well the way
[  870.00-  890.00] MEE073: you were doing i was going to ask if the way you were doing it you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you are not doing the object so you do not need to just cause if we are if we do have to like if the inverted search says that there is you know ten documents are we going to have to load each of these ten corp corp just to do the individual next the next research
[  890.40-  900.00] MEE071: that way it does not crash as you try and load all ten and while it crashes the other way it is a bit dumb if you can fool it if you c if you c load up ten different s engines so it will tell you
[  893.80-  895.32] MEE073: yeah i think probably yeah
[  900.00-  930.00] MEE071: ly it can do that fine but can not do them can not do them if thinks they are one cause then is about the amount that each if you you have to kind of call a new class and then will do fine but if you do not know will not yeah says ok oh yeah i have got all this space you can do some otherwise goes oh no is a nice machine goes yeah
[  902.40-  904.76] FEO072: really ok
[  902.56-  903.96] MEE073: it sure is
[  910.84-  914.84] MEE073: yeah ok yeah that is insane ok
[  911.78-  930.00] FEO072: alright well ok it is more difficult yeah ok does it talk to you now does it yeah spend too much time on the
[  917.38-  920.94] MEE073: yeah ok ok ok
[  930.00-  942.40] FEO072: alright well i have been i have been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterization which is good so i can fill that in now the windows are all there now after lots of music
[  937.96-  939.24] MEE073: ok
[  942.76-  944.24] MEE071: oh they are done are they ok cool
[  944.48-  960.00] FEO072: well you know just the pop a pop up window is difficult yeah because it it m basically has to set up like whatever ten pop up windows in memory as in already initialize them because there is there might be ten speaker
[  946.44-  947.52] MEE071: they pop up
[  960.00-  990.00] FEO072: is and now all have to have different me windows and and i am working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the of the topics of of the meetings that that topic we have mentioned in and i have a a question about the we said we wanted a start screen what kind of start screen do we want i mean do we want some general blurb about welcomed
[  960.60-  962.32] MEE073: ok
[  975.00-  975.36] MEE073: ok
[  990.00- 1001.94] FEO072: browser or something yeah some animation stuff
[  990.84- 1007.32] MEE071: well it is an s then an s d browser some some some speech and some music some some it does not take too long though we have to you know while we are debugging while we are
[  991.12- 1020.00] MEE073: or just or is it more like right
[ 1009.30- 1018.20] FEO072: yeah so do we want yeah maybe we could write in on like the m whatever it is called at the top of the window saying welcome to meet your browser
[ 1018.48- 1020.00] MEE071: yeah or a switchboard
[ 1020.00- 1027.96] MEE071: that comes up that is just a blank form like that with some buttons on load me a meeting load me a search load me something else whistle a tune
[ 1023.06- 1023.32] MEE073: yeah
[ 1026.28- 1026.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 1029.22- 1043.80] FEO072: yeah but how i mean at the moment the way it is it is a it is a drop down menu as you see with all the and that because it is it is the dialog class that you use there
[ 1034.40- 1035.44] MEE073: yeah
[ 1035.08- 1035.52] MEE071: yeah
[ 1037.84- 1039.48] MEE073: yeah should yeah
[ 1044.60- 1050.00] MEE073: yeah i was just going to ask if we should assume that they will want to load a meeting first but not necessarily i guess if we are doing a search on
[ 1050.00- 1052.40] MEE073: the entire you know purpose
[ 1051.44- 1061.44] FEO072: yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search and through that once you have got the results you click on something and that will be the first
[ 1057.64- 1058.92] MEE073: yeah that does not make sense
[ 1057.94- 1065.36] MEE071: that is all that is the stupid n h t search it would need you to have a meeting loaded before you are starting any searching at all does it
[ 1064.88- 1067.92] MEE073: right well we can put the logic in it yeah
[ 1065.24- 1067.26] FEO072: oh does it oh
[ 1067.74- 1072.96] MEE071: you can not the the only thing you can search is a night object model and the only time you have one of those of you loaded an observation
[ 1068.46- 1069.88] FEO072: oh do this is it
[ 1072.70- 1078.84] MEE073: i could probably even that is should not be too hard to put a check in there and if it has not loaded then force them to load it
[ 1074.04- 1074.48] FEO072: oh
[ 1079.16- 1080.00] MEE071: yeah what do we but
[ 1080.00- 1090.60] MEE071: does not that we c you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you will not
[ 1090.92- 1093.52] FEO072: can you not get this normal object
[ 1093.68- 1108.88] MEE071: it has to be an observation and even if you go and s you can go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason the engine there is only one there is only one search method to the search engine the engine class only has one search method
[ 1104.86- 1105.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 1108.08- 1110.00] FEO072: i suppose we would not want to use you know
[ 1110.00- 1118.00] FEO072: we yeah we would not want to use n x t at the beginning anyway because we do not want to search locally we want to search locally so so let us say
[ 1114.84- 1115.96] MEE071: yeah global
[ 1117.56- 1120.72] MEE073: unless they know what meeting it is well yeah
[ 1119.48- 1119.74] MEE071: yeah
[ 1120.36- 1130.78] FEO072: well no then they would open the meeting first right so let us say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
[ 1122.76- 1123.00] MEE071: yeah
[ 1122.76- 1123.02] MEE073: yeah
[ 1131.16- 1131.48] MEE071: yeah
[ 1135.08- 1140.00] MEE073: yeah or well the things they mean just be looking for a word and you know and we can if it shows up ten
[ 1140.00- 1149.64] MEE073: in different meetings then at that point they will probably want to like do we want to like if it by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned you mean then you have to go through
[ 1143.36- 1143.64] FEO072: yeah
[ 1149.80- 1152.22] FEO072: yeah but why do we want default i mean just you know
[ 1151.84- 1154.24] MEE073: well then like to load up like the thing is i think
[ 1155.80- 1170.00] MEE073: like when it loads up it will load up the transcript window and the whatever is that window right now i think just the topic ones although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data so i am just thinking
[ 1170.00- 1180.08] MEE073: thinking if it is kinda like you were saying you have to have a nom object right i mean what do you do a search it all on the side yeah ok yeah that is true
[ 1177.12- 1182.00] FEO072: yeah but local search we can do global search without anything it is pretty
[ 1181.32- 1184.76] MEE071: do not take it on to load up anyway you can load a dumb one up and done that with the
[ 1184.52- 1196.54] MEE073: yeah but the ok the global one feeds into the local so if we are getting any usable data it is it is going to be doing a search on each of those files so it is going to be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data when we want
[ 1189.04- 1190.68] FEO072: yeah i mean the local
[ 1194.40- 1200.00] FEO072: yeah but yeah the the global inverted file search
[ 1200.00- 1203.92] FEO072: gives the non objects basically to the local search right
[ 1203.72- 1204.34] MEE071: ticky yeah
[ 1204.28- 1208.84] MEE073: right but it is it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that they put this in
[ 1207.72- 1209.80] FEO072: well yeah that is always going to be the case with search
[ 1210.30- 1213.88] MEE071: yeah well it gives one at a time anyway does not it cause otherwise you would crush the thing
[ 1210.60- 1210.76] MEE073: well
[ 1214.24- 1230.00] MEE073: yeah well i am ju just thinking of some way we could you know s cache the results in in a nice little format that will make things a bit easier but the thing is i mean if we have got that then it is going to be needing really mu really to load the entire corpus for that meeting
[ 1230.00- 1248.36] MEE073: if if it is trying to show us where those were if it is trying to highlight those in the text transcript or whatever then we are going to have to have all that other data in there so each time when we have the sh search window and we have like you know ten different meetings you know the word wireless comes up go to meeting one and has to re log the nom object next one
[ 1249.52- 1255.24] MEE071: yeah it is not too slow though i do not think sh it is not not too bad on that i do not think that will be a ten minutes more problem
[ 1250.26- 1253.38] MEE073: could be yeah ok
[ 1255.38- 1260.00] MEE073: it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that is all i am but i think your ladle is just for
[ 1258.66- 1259.36] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 1259.56- 1259.94] FEO072: oh right
[ 1260.00- 1274.64] MEE073: loading it up test it try to run it and shut down hold it up so so just sorta based on that as well yeah but if it does not take that long each time then it should be alright
[ 1265.12- 1265.64] MEE071: yeah
[ 1275.54- 1290.00] FEO072: i mean you can you know the option is to do a search in the way that if you do a global search first as a first step only return the meetings as in the n not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so you know say you want to
[ 1281.36- 1281.62] MEE073: right
[ 1286.26- 1287.74] MEE073: yeah right
[ 1290.00- 1301.30] FEO072: search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language and then you can decide well i want to search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting or
[ 1296.04- 1296.22] MEE073: yeah
[ 1299.16- 1300.06] MEE073: yeah that is true
[ 1302.14- 1309.20] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah make it strings for as long as possible and then on your return things when they actually s but then it needs to has to search when it needs to be like
[ 1302.16- 1302.96] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 1305.36- 1305.68] MEE073: yeah
[ 1308.24- 1320.00] MEE073: yeah that make sense and that way if they know specifically which meeting it is and that will save the time because i am sure they do not want to have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it so or they can
[ 1312.68- 1313.04] FEO072: yeah
[ 1314.00- 1314.28] MEE071: yeah
[ 1317.16- 1317.54] MEE071: yeah
[ 1318.46- 1319.16] FEO072: definitely
[ 1319.12- 1319.32] MEE071: yeah
[ 1320.00- 1322.00] MEE073: check mark against the ones they want to check so
[ 1322.44- 1324.72] MEE071: did we think about
[ 1326.80- 1328.24] MEE071: better names for the meetings
[ 1329.88- 1338.38] MEE073: well i think they were in the text we can probably do that ourselves and just sorta b d b you do not just do a a straight yeah
[ 1334.84- 1350.00] FEO072: there is yeah in the in in one of the papers they have n names such as better understanding or whatever even one of those yeah one of those even even better understanding or
[ 1340.88- 1349.02] MEE073: yeah the long names yeah yeah like the the working group that it is part of yeah i would probably just use the name yeah
[ 1341.96- 1343.54] MEE071: oh do they do they re translate them
[ 1346.08- 1348.76] MEE071: do they ok well that is alright then we will just use every
[ 1350.00- 1355.40] FEO072: something i i love that i love that
[ 1350.52- 1351.28] MEE073: yeah
[ 1351.18- 1358.52] MEE071: well that is that is a that is a working group is it i want to see the meetings around even better understanding
[ 1353.08- 1353.94] MEE073: yeah
[ 1358.16- 1359.48] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 1359.98- 1361.08] MEE073: sive it is accurate
[ 1361.30- 1363.64] FEO072: so i have yeah i have put that in already to
[ 1364.32- 1365.56] MEE071: ok that is cool that is good
[ 1365.12- 1365.62] FEO072: to
[ 1367.96- 1373.60] FEO072: so yeah again concretely to the startup startup white rings window
[ 1380.32- 1387.64] MEE071: so who would have the i d f s i mean the d f s document frequencies for each word of course
[ 1386.88- 1387.96] FEO072: well you know
[ 1387.12- 1390.20] MEE073: do we actually need the of the frequencies
[ 1390.58- 1395.08] MEE071: yeah to do what tiskeev is talking about do you know to do the topic label
[ 1392.94- 1393.16] MEE073: yeah
[ 1394.80- 1396.58] MEE073: oh right that right yeah ok yeah
[ 1396.54- 1400.90] FEO072: yeah how is that i mean do you think you would have have time for that as well
[ 1401.60- 1404.26] MEE073: well the thing is if it is being done there were there was
[ 1402.44- 1407.90] MEE071: if somebody is done the keywords or the the i d f s or the d f s already would mean not too properly better
[ 1406.50- 1410.00] MEE073: yeah there is a clash he was trying to get to work on
[ 1410.00- 1431.08] MEE073: friday that did have all that and it was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but it last i heard it was not working so she was going to look at you know more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we need it to do but if we need the if we do need the frequencies then
[ 1430.72- 1433.04] MEE071: how do you do it in inverted class search without the t f i do
[ 1433.68- 1434.68] MEE073: i do not know
[ 1435.68- 1440.00] MEE071: think you need to have that would have been like a oyster
[ 1437.84- 1440.00] MEE073: well it would have been like a lot of stuff
[ 1438.30- 1440.00] FEO072: well what is t f i d f stand
[ 1440.00- 1440.30] FEO072: point
[ 1440.00- 1469.20] MEE071: it is the amount that y occur over term documents basically amount d f is document frequency is amount that each word occurs no what is it term frequency is amount that that it occurs in e one of m is amount that occurs in each document and o r one is amount that g occurs generally so if you so more it occurs in specific documents compared to it is general score better more informative it is about a certain
[ 1440.00- 1440.40] MEE073: for
[ 1443.88- 1444.52] MEE073: what does it sound for
[ 1462.40- 1463.50] FEO072: oh ok
[ 1465.28- 1465.68] MEE073: yeah
[ 1465.32- 1467.12] FEO072: yeah
[ 1468.84- 1470.00] FEO072: so the general score would that
[ 1470.00- 1479.30] FEO072: be a for the whole of the language or the for the for the whole of course ok ok well you know you you might have some general frequencies
[ 1473.04- 1485.48] MEE071: they probably the core core score is still data yeah yeah yeah yeah b plus a stock list so you remove stuff that does not that like and and the which is going to have an a probably basically equal score
[ 1473.52- 1481.88] MEE073: corpus yeah so yeah probably general frequency yeah sorry general one of them yeah yeah
[ 1481.52- 1482.72] FEO072: oh i see
[ 1484.68- 1484.84] MEE073: right
[ 1485.72- 1495.08] FEO072: so what would the if we had the these face topics what what would they look like a bunch just a list of like three words or something
[ 1487.42- 1487.96] MEE071: well no
[ 1489.64- 1500.00] MEE071: bunch of keywords yeah that would probably be the easiest stuff keywords yeah keywords i could use clear words inverse stock list yeah
[ 1496.32- 1500.00] MEE073: what is the i in t f idea do not know yeah
[ 1500.00- 1501.88] MEE071: term frequency based off on frequency
[ 1504.28- 1508.44] MEE071: i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i do not know whether it will work i suppose
[ 1506.68- 1506.88] MEE073: alright
[ 1507.80- 1526.12] FEO072: i do not know because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it cause if you just have the segmentation that is great but we can not we can not compare it to the to the hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool
[ 1508.56- 1508.84] MEE073: alright
[ 1515.64- 1516.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1520.32- 1520.68] MEE071: yeah
[ 1524.82- 1525.14] MEE071: yeah
[ 1526.60- 1530.00] MEE071: yeah but also keywords gives you an own whole new type of set
[ 1527.18- 1527.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 1530.00- 1540.48] MEE071: he had a new keyword search but it could do keyword search could be topic search could not it could be the same thing instead of it would just search for keywords and it when it when they tell em their projection of the topics but actually get such as keywords
[ 1542.04- 1543.16] MEE071: for each do you see what i mean
[ 1548.48- 1550.00] FEO072: yeah that would be very nice
[ 1553.40- 1560.00] MEE071: well i suppose even calculating the the the the what is its faces themselves
[ 1560.00- 1576.24] MEE071: that would be too much too long the easy bit is it is probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in i in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic cause you do not have to integrate as much information
[ 1573.48- 1574.96] FEO072: yeah yeah definitely
[ 1574.36- 1574.64] MEE073: right
[ 1579.72- 1583.60] MEE071: no you can do you can do search without t f i d f you just can not rank a search
[ 1584.68- 1590.00] MEE073: oh yeah do we need to i mean we are just looking oh for your for your stuff i guess
[ 1585.04- 1589.46] FEO072: yeah that is why i am thinking too yeah well do we want to do we want to
[ 1587.16- 1590.00] MEE071: yeah no no
[ 1590.00- 1594.88] MEE071: no no but that is what is not that what the idea was in the first place to rank these rank the results so that
[ 1590.00- 1590.82] MEE073: a very topical
[ 1595.18- 1604.24] FEO072: sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed up speed the search up because n x d was m the whole of the corpus were just not feasible they would
[ 1600.62- 1600.92] MEE073: yeah
[ 1602.64- 1606.00] MEE071: yeah but that might slow down ranking might slow down
[ 1602.82- 1603.04] MEE073: yeah
[ 1607.36- 1615.32] FEO072: no but the general inverted file oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that would just be a nice extra
[ 1610.68- 1618.18] MEE071: yeah it still uses an inverted file but ranks the results by the amount by the height yeah i thought that was part of it but yeah ok does not matter
[ 1618.26- 1620.00] FEO072: yeah i i was not sure
[ 1620.00- 1626.32] FEO072: true true true say what it is only inter
[ 1620.00- 1627.46] MEE073: i do not think we have that in the the document yeah yeah yeah you are ok you are not
[ 1622.44- 1627.10] MEE071: no we did not yeah yeah
[ 1629.76- 1633.74] MEE071: but yeah i guess if you that if if that is not part of it do not worry about it it does not
[ 1630.00- 1630.18] MEE073: yeah
[ 1633.64- 1637.84] MEE073: yeah yeah nice to have that i have a lot of time anyway
[ 1633.68- 1649.98] FEO072: yeah i mean if you have time that would be really nice cause i mean then then it would give you like if you search for word it would give you the the meetings but also how often the that word occurred in that meeting that would be so useful yeah yeah exactly
[ 1635.60- 1637.84] MEE071: cause i am only going to do this if i have got time anyway so
[ 1646.84- 1650.00] MEE071: yeah well it would just give you a rank it would that was the whole point it was the
[ 1648.18- 1650.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 1650.00- 1652.82] MEE071: so you would say this is your top one this is your bottom
[ 1650.00- 1663.18] MEE073: no actually cause the thing is i mean t yeah but the the thing is we are just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they are looking for a particular term or something they just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and i want to see it yeah
[ 1652.88- 1653.36] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 1662.34- 1667.46] MEE071: yeah but is it but is how how informative that t f i d f is an informity score is not it is it
[ 1662.54- 1676.54] FEO072: yeah but it will be useful if you yeah you know you c if you have if if you search for language and you return like you know basically all of the meetings you want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they are just mentioned it at once
[ 1667.08- 1667.26] MEE073: yeah
[ 1672.34- 1672.62] MEE073: kay
[ 1675.70- 1680.00] MEE073: but if it is like a two word term does a t f i d f and
[ 1679.60- 1680.00] MEE071: do not say
[ 1680.00- 1682.30] MEE071: treat your compound nouns like
[ 1680.00- 1698.42] MEE073: analy it is not a compound noun it is just two words together in i do not know i do not know just something like edinburgh university yeah well essentially i think it is a sunny day yeah
[ 1684.30- 1685.24] MEE071: well like what
[ 1690.68- 1691.42] FEO072: language and
[ 1693.08- 1701.08] MEE071: that is a compound noun sorry no yeah like an adjective yeah
[ 1696.08- 1700.04] FEO072: oh just like edinburgh and language ok
[ 1703.04- 1710.00] MEE071: in its most simple form it would do separate rank for each one each term you could make it more complicated than make it a different
[ 1707.52- 1707.72] MEE073: yeah
[ 1709.44- 1710.00] MEE073: let us not maybe
[ 1710.00- 1711.64] MEE071: but there yeah
[ 1710.00- 1732.38] MEE073: it get more complicated because the thing is thing is that way we were doing we were just looking for words period each word in in index well that is way we were thinking of it and n n it is just saying were se two words in in any of se documents and n if it was n we would go closer and do n x d search to look for exact term or regular expression or whatever
[ 1711.04- 1715.48] FEO072: and then and then add add those up or some or maybe combine with them
[ 1714.08- 1716.98] MEE071: yeah but you can get just how much more you know
[ 1720.42- 1722.84] MEE071: yeah yeah you do not want to start working for me
[ 1728.46- 1729.76] MEE071: yeah
[ 1732.24- 1740.00] MEE071: i guess you just do a sum of the of the the individual t f i d f for each term returned
[ 1740.00- 1747.74] MEE071: and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a score and the higher the more the more informative each term is for each thing it will give you a
[ 1749.56- 1752.28] MEE071: be of your high thing it is pretty crude anyway they are just looking for
[ 1754.16- 1765.86] MEE071: if it is all it is going to do is look for se separate oh cause then it is going to go into the the n x t session the ten now is not it so yeah yeah yeah that is true so yeah that is that is good
[ 1758.56- 1762.42] MEE073: yeah or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that so yeah
[ 1766.20- 1770.00] MEE073: like i am just wondering if it is going to give us something cool then yeah absolutely but if it
[ 1770.00- 1776.36] MEE073: sort of like if the n x t search is still got to be run to find these terms or these you know these patterns yeah
[ 1774.88- 1780.52] MEE071: groups of terms yeah without doing any like word pairs just like
[ 1779.56- 1793.56] MEE073: or also like do wild cards work for something like that so if you are looking for a wireless wired wire blah blah blah you can do wire with a star and no not as well actually that is a problem for me too so or yeah
[ 1788.52- 1800.00] MEE071: yeah i do not know how that will actually yeah that is yeah but the the idea is that gives you an uniformity score how you can
[ 1796.84- 1798.46] MEE073: yeah
[ 1800.00- 1820.58] MEE071: line that is is up to you i guess if there is lots in there let us try if if you were it is there is a lo whole load about it in manning and shoulds so they have got a whole chunk about it is sort of just i r is not it is the basic information that we have got a big a good chapter on it if you have not got it is on cognate
[ 1803.28- 1806.52] MEE073: it should it should work ok i am s yeah i am s not about it
[ 1810.36- 1810.56] MEE073: oh
[ 1814.54- 1816.46] MEE073: oh yeah ok
[ 1818.80- 1823.42] MEE073: yeah i have got somewhere p d f
[ 1824.22- 1828.78] MEE071: yeah me too hundreds of videos
[ 1827.28- 1830.00] MEE073: yeah one of us yeah do the p d f switch it to all the
[ 1830.00- 1831.30] MEE073: to have switched it back to p d h or
[ 1831.54- 1832.44] MEE071: yeah
[ 1835.80- 1838.94] MEE073: ok so that is ok that would be good
[ 1840.84- 1842.20] MEE073: ok
[ 1842.88- 1860.00] FEO072: so to come back to the start screen i am i am i am i am very unsure about what that should look like i mean we want to for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting what kind of information do you want to have about the meeting i mean the the the longer name obviously
[ 1845.22- 1848.18] MEE073: oh ok that is sort of the truth
[ 1845.60- 1847.52] MEE071: ok
[ 1860.00- 1871.46] FEO072: if there is one cause they do not all have a long line what the users that spoke users that took part then that is probably pretty much the same for the same group
[ 1860.24- 1861.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 1867.64- 1869.24] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 1872.58- 1877.96] MEE073: p probab for the most part i mean there will be a set of people that do another subset feature meeting probably
[ 1874.64- 1875.24] FEO072: yeah i am not sure
[ 1876.28- 1879.36] MEE071: so now on the start up screen yeah
[ 1878.76- 1884.44] FEO072: yeah just to give them an idea general idea what there is and so they can pick a a top and a meeting
[ 1884.04- 1890.00] MEE073: search for stuff or start working kind of a bit or browse ok like search
[ 1886.88- 1888.76] MEE071: yeah i guess i yeah yeah i guess that is you know
[ 1890.00- 1891.48] MEE073: browse
[ 1893.48- 1904.22] MEE073: like if you are looking for something specif like is that what you are thinking like if they if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to you know that meeting on december third and they just want to go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and browse that so
[ 1900.44- 1900.68] FEO072: yeah
[ 1902.16- 1913.58] FEO072: yeah or you know yeah i want to look at the meeting where so and so spoke of that you know sort of some sort of research group i want that first meeting look at that
[ 1906.84- 1907.08] MEE073: yeah
[ 1911.70- 1911.90] MEE073: right
[ 1913.84- 1914.08] MEE073: yeah
[ 1918.06- 1920.00] MEE073: yeah browse
[ 1920.00- 1939.24] MEE073: by meeting browse by browse by speaker like d no i am just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top like if they are looking for particular person particular working group particular whatever then we just we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want or we could keep it more general yeah
[ 1925.04- 1926.24] FEO072: oh oh
[ 1937.60- 1950.00] FEO072: i do not think we need that yeah because we we just want to have a way of of yeah because as soon as they have got loaded their first meeting y they can they can browse through that
[ 1950.00- 1950.68] FEO072: quite nicely
[ 1951.76- 1964.80] MEE073: yeah but i am just thinking like initially when they load up what are the range of things that they would want to do like if they are part of x working group alone getting there do we want to say preferences
[ 1958.34- 1958.64] FEO072: yeah
[ 1967.08- 1967.60] FEO072: what do you mean
[ 1967.86- 1973.84] MEE073: well if they are part of b d b working group they are going to want to look at the b d b ones and some default to that or i dunno
[ 1973.78- 1975.08] FEO072: well how how are we going to know that
[ 1976.10- 1980.00] MEE073: based on what they did the last time
[ 1977.60- 1979.82] FEO072: how do you think that is a lot
[ 1978.80- 1980.00] MEE071: they can have a site perfect
[ 1980.00- 1982.84] MEE071: preferences you could have a safe present preferences i guess
[ 1980.00- 1980.84] MEE073: yeah
[ 1983.12- 1983.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 1984.18- 2009.40] FEO072: but that would defy the whole point of browsing right if you only wanted to look at all the fine people yeah well you just you just scroll down the list and find your favorite what i mean it is not like they would come back every day and do the same browsing that is who it is charged with yeah
[ 1986.88- 1999.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 1987.96- 1994.48] MEE071: well alright call it favorites then you can have a favorite
[ 1997.22- 2001.04] MEE071: yeah it is not enough emulation as it does not work out
[ 2003.40- 2010.00] MEE073: what was last night i forgot i forgot i did oh
[ 2010.00- 2040.00] MEE073: ok well no i am just getting back to the sort of what could be on the the start up screen like there is just a range of things we could do we could have like search options browse options i mean just i do not know just playing around with ideas and then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting then do this blah blah blah so we can yeah sort of you know guide them and just
[ 2015.02- 2015.60] MEE071: yeah
[ 2015.12- 2015.66] FEO072: yeah
[ 2037.22- 2038.68] FEO072: oh right oh ok
[ 2040.00- 2047.36] MEE073: like hey my task is to do this and there is a button for it perfect you know you know i do not know
[ 2040.48- 2040.80] FEO072: well
[ 2042.88- 2047.82] FEO072: yeah no
[ 2045.06- 2046.26] MEE071: no
[ 2048.04- 2049.56] MEE071: yeah it would be quite good if it has yeah
[ 2050.24- 2058.64] FEO072: i i was not going to put any you know any any help in the any sort of explanation of how the browser works to be honest i was not
[ 2056.82- 2070.00] MEE073: no no that is not what i am suggesting no i am just saying like these are just like a lot of programs well kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first just cause they do not want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like too commonly
[ 2057.20- 2060.00] MEE071: just a search buttons search
[ 2070.00- 2076.24] MEE073: use tasks or just exit and just let me use the program you know as well so
[ 2070.20- 2071.40] FEO072: yeah i see
[ 2074.56- 2076.56] MEE071: yeah yeah do for smart
[ 2076.16- 2079.36] FEO072: but i mean the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting like
[ 2079.92- 2082.36] MEE073: probably or search something yeah yeah
[ 2080.96- 2098.44] MEE071: a search yeah yeah so if even if it just had two things just said one so one said take me straight to this meeting and have a text box you get into it or drop down menu and then another one that said search that load it instantly plug it up a search yeah yeah yeah or one that yeah or one
[ 2081.52- 2084.20] FEO072: yeah we will search yeah search and so that those we have
[ 2092.24- 2097.04] MEE073: yep like find specific meeting yeah that is meeting sort of yeah yeah
[ 2098.22- 2100.00] FEO072: yeah that o all happens when the
[ 2100.00- 2110.16] FEO072: search basically either the user w knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it or he does not and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
[ 2100.94- 2101.20] MEE071: yeah
[ 2108.72- 2110.76] MEE073: yeah so just cranking out
[ 2109.60- 2118.00] MEE071: well the other thing to do is just have search as the default just it opens and the search window opens and that is the interface and you just go from there
[ 2118.70- 2119.28] FEO072: yeah
[ 2121.22- 2130.00] MEE071: and then that brings up the browser after you for search for something or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down mainly
[ 2130.00- 2155.40] MEE071: that says just and a go button that said take me to this so the so the yeah so the f only thing that comes up when you are finished is a when you start it is just one window like that and it has got all the search stuff right down there so this is your search just all here and here is just go to wherever and the go button and then from there it takes you to wherever where you should go yeah
[ 2132.64- 2135.52] FEO072: oh i see what you mean inside the segment yeah
[ 2153.28- 2154.68] FEO072: yeah that is that is what yep
[ 2157.04- 2160.00] MEE071: and the the top it says welcome to welcome to out
[ 2159.16- 2160.00] FEO072: oh
[ 2160.00- 2176.46] FEO072: yeah that looks about right but i am i am unsure about how to how to put all the information in there cause we need log down menu but we want all the information about the name the longer the name is the user users so how to have
[ 2160.00- 2160.48] MEE071: browse with it
[ 2168.12- 2169.64] MEE071: i drop drop down there
[ 2173.44- 2176.56] MEE071: oh you want yeah yeah
[ 2175.76- 2180.72] MEE073: well we do not actually have usernames do we are not there all these codes like maybe eleven or whatever yeah
[ 2178.32- 2179.42] MEE071: there was many
[ 2178.62- 2185.68] FEO072: the codes i mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in other to in other corpus copies
[ 2182.64- 2183.00] MEE073: yeah
[ 2184.38- 2185.16] MEE071: yeah that is true
[ 2185.20- 2187.88] MEE073: in a case like a we do want drop down we do not want them to type them do we
[ 2189.68- 2190.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 2190.00- 2192.28] FEO072: with drop down and stuff like that not
[ 2190.80- 2191.28] MEE071: yeah
[ 2191.80- 2198.80] MEE073: ok and allow multiple no ok you are just looking for one specific it is a bigger one
[ 2197.32- 2216.20] MEE071: this is good w if you want to search your search if you want to look for one meeting and just look at it that is fine that is that is true that is or if you have two one one is one one there well you got two one for meeting one is a speaker and you can choose you can go go for go or go for the other you can not go for both go for both and search
[ 2200.84- 2204.56] FEO072: yep yeah yeah but then yeah as i said i had to do
[ 2201.40- 2201.76] MEE073: ok
[ 2202.52- 2202.78] MEE073: ok
[ 2210.52- 2211.46] MEE073: oh first meeting meeting
[ 2215.30- 2220.00] FEO072: no no no i am not i am not saying you can you can pick a user but it should
[ 2220.00- 2233.44] FEO072: come up with some list but an extended list of the of the meeting so you know you have a b d r whatever it was called o one and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants
[ 2224.24- 2224.62] MEE071: yeah
[ 2233.70- 2240.52] MEE071: we could do microsoft style and hold it over and then pops up a thing
[ 2236.88- 2241.00] MEE073: oh yeah
[ 2238.02- 2250.00] FEO072: i was thinking that yeah but then yeah no it is not at all i think it is all to yeah i have not tried that yet but i was i was going to take that but it is a
[ 2242.02- 2243.02] MEE071: is that complicated
[ 2244.92- 2246.16] MEE073: a tool tip yeah
[ 2248.82- 2250.00] MEE071: house over is not it or something
[ 2250.00- 2274.02] FEO072: breached numbers yeah yeah i am not sure what is that very is that not annoying if you have to hold it you know you have you have to yes they do that a lot do not they no but you know to to search for a u perciv perc specific user you have to h hold your mouse over that one wait for it to pop up and wait for that point yeah
[ 2250.00- 2252.60] MEE071: the action is on oh let us do that then
[ 2258.32- 2264.10] MEE071: get out of the bloody way i am trying to search for that bit yeah
[ 2260.96- 2261.16] MEE073: yeah
[ 2270.68- 2272.78] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 2270.76- 2280.00] MEE071: yeah that is true that is annoying but that is why you could just have a list of your users then and just you just say i want to look for this user could i
[ 2280.00- 2295.96] MEE071: find find me and then then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that user and then you search then but then you are doing search maybe just leave it just have the meeting names there and do not worry about the speakers if they are doing speakers they are doing search it is not the same as doing a quick access
[ 2292.46- 2292.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 2294.40- 2294.68] MEE073: yeah
[ 2298.16- 2310.00] FEO072: yeah it would just be nice to have some basic information on each one yeah i am thinking that that updates depending on how i did yeah maybe that is the best idea then so you have got
[ 2301.16- 2308.20] MEE071: yeah or you could have a text box there that is dot yeah as you go over there and then that does not get in the in the way
[ 2305.48- 2309.54] MEE073: yeah depending on the yeah
[ 2310.00- 2314.88] FEO072: drop down menu a search a search button not search go button
[ 2317.12- 2317.76] FEO072: and then
[ 2320.00- 2323.66] FEO072: some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you have got highlighted
[ 2323.88- 2326.18] MEE071: yeah the full name and then speakers
[ 2326.36- 2328.00] FEO072: yeah yeah that sounds good
[ 2328.44- 2332.84] MEE071: yeah we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a
[ 2334.64- 2335.04] MEE071: a thing
[ 2336.36- 2336.68] FEO072: i think
[ 2337.24- 2340.00] MEE071: a call a a a thing a meeting and on
[ 2338.78- 2340.00] FEO072: none
[ 2340.00- 2344.96] FEO072: yeah what does nom actually sound for
[ 2340.00- 2342.64] MEE071: yeah
[ 2340.24- 2341.64] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 2345.38- 2349.56] MEE071: i think it is a knight object model model or is it i think
[ 2346.08- 2354.42] MEE073: i s yeah i am sorry just but it is i think in that case it is the right corpus so it is right or corpus or something yeah
[ 2346.96- 2349.30] FEO072: nite oh yes
[ 2351.76- 2360.68] MEE071: night yeah is your right is the right corpus yeah it is the knight right corpus and then you got knight right elements and then you got knight right actually it is
[ 2354.36- 2355.24] FEO072: no
[ 2357.94- 2359.24] MEE073: yeah
[ 2358.12- 2363.58] FEO072: oh yeah well you have got lots of nom something and then night something and then end something
[ 2361.92- 2364.88] MEE073: yeah yeah next to the
[ 2363.60- 2370.00] MEE071: yeah i think the n ones are interfaces and the knight one one of the ways round one is an interface and one is actually an implemented cor
[ 2367.58- 2369.82] FEO072: oh really
[ 2369.30- 2369.84] MEE073: i
[ 2370.00- 2380.96] MEE071: i see cause you go back and off and the the what is his name the week end the a p i is alright but there is not a lot of description in it it is very creepy it tells you what
[ 2377.84- 2378.24] MEE073: yeah
[ 2378.92- 2391.58] FEO072: no and most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying we have got to update this jonathan this is this is un unintelligible great i know it
[ 2383.74- 2400.00] MEE071: yeah yeah so you end up just it returns a n text box ok what is that no it is a an implementation of an n text error
[ 2385.44- 2391.12] MEE073: yeah right
[ 2396.64- 2396.94] MEE073: yeah
[ 2399.16- 2400.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 2399.52- 2400.00] MEE073: yeah right
[ 2400.00- 2412.00] MEE071: i interface what is that oh it is a extended version it went oh stop it
[ 2400.00- 2400.52] MEE073: is that
[ 2403.96- 2416.20] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah definitely not very fun right so anyone else got anything to say
[ 2406.38- 2409.80] MEE073: yeah that is crazy
[ 2413.38- 2413.88] MEE073: right
[ 2416.62- 2419.20] MEE073: not really just going to keep on going
[ 2421.20- 2425.80] FEO072: do we yeah do we want another meeting at the end of the week with pennell
[ 2427.60- 2428.70] MEE071: might be useful might not
[ 2428.60- 2430.00] FEO072: yeah
[ 2429.08- 2430.00] MEE073: like friday afternoon or so
[ 2430.00- 2436.12] FEO072: yeah i see that i mean it i think i am going to do quite a bit of work this week so i will have probably more to talk about
[ 2430.00- 2430.24] MEE073: ok
[ 2436.96- 2438.08] MEE071: yeah i should have more to talk about

[ 2507.76- 2519.20] MEE073: or if we could try one we could try shortly after well y yeah well yeah well it would not be a long meeting then or no would you want to no probably not if one is bad for you then we will ok
[ 2510.68- 2511.06] FEO072: yeah
[ 2515.72- 2520.00] FEO072: no no that that would only give us like
[ 2520.00- 2527.52] FEO072: thirty five minutes or something well what i work quite late like you know five or six
[ 2522.36- 2522.78] MEE073: ok
[ 2524.38- 2526.22] MEE071: it is my i do not mean we need a
[ 2527.92- 2529.04] MEE071: three is better than five or six
[ 2528.54- 2529.32] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 2531.16- 2532.82] FEO072: well three o clock let us say three o clock
[ 2532.26- 2543.44] MEE071: three say say three o clock and then if there is a problem with that then if three o clock is a problem five or six will be a problem i do not know why i be here but i do not think that will be i am not sure
[ 2541.56- 2541.96] FEO072: ok
[ 2544.14- 2548.74] FEO072: right i will write i will write this meeting up and i will send it to him in there as well
[ 2548.86- 2549.96] MEE073: ok
[ 2550.00- 2566.48] MEE071: collecting them or you are just sending it to us for no i mean that she collected oh right oh yeah sorry yeah it is cool for the gifty well i thought somebody was collecting them but that is what i thought really good
[ 2551.44- 2568.26] FEO072: no because she is not here i collect meeting summaries yeah no we should probably do that in the next one
[ 2554.98- 2555.14] MEE073: no
[ 2568.48- 2568.74] MEE073: no
[ 2568.98- 2572.62] MEE071: then we would know who has missed them or who has done any
[ 2570.20- 2580.00] FEO072: so can we just can we just repeat briefly what we have spoken about so we have din done a progress on the speaker characterization who does the speaker character
[ 2578.94- 2579.04] MEE071: yeah
[ 2580.00- 2594.88] FEO072: proversion we mentioned topic labeling with keywords we discussed if the search should be ranked and martel do you have anything else
[ 2586.12- 2586.36] MEE071: yeah
[ 2594.70- 2609.96] MEE073: there is just sort of the basic implementation stuff that i was wondering about but no it should be fine no it is just progressing we did we decide whether it should be ranked no or no
[ 2604.72- 2605.40] FEO072: oh sorry
[ 2608.16- 2608.48] MEE071: no
[ 2608.48- 2610.00] FEO072: oh well basically
[ 2610.00- 2615.48] FEO072: not not unless you have got time for it at the end it will be nice at the end
[ 2613.98- 2635.26] MEE073: yeah well i th i kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it is not it is not really getting them together like if someone is looking for a particular term i dunno just just do not know if it would bring us that much
[ 2635.46- 2640.00] FEO072: i think it would yeah i think i think it will you would
[ 2636.68- 2637.08] MEE073: how so
[ 2640.00- 2642.36] FEO072: would it would give you the most relevant result
[ 2640.92- 2658.12] MEE073: if if if they are looking for like i say sunny day and you know sunny shows up in this document day shows up with the note together or if they are to i do not it just does not you are looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
[ 2658.28- 2670.00] FEO072: no but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as a you know some some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they are
[ 2670.00- 2683.78] FEO072: that word like in every sentence and then you have got those that just mention you know mention it briefly like once or twice saying you know my language is german or something stupid that you do not really want so you want to distinguish those somehow all pretty nice anyway
[ 2672.40- 2672.58] MEE073: yeah
[ 2679.32- 2679.52] MEE073: right
[ 2684.26- 2694.20] MEE071: yeah that would help a lot for that for single terms it would be very useful for multiple terms unless you want to do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
[ 2684.62- 2688.12] MEE073: in in that sense for single for single word yeah yeah
[ 2686.96- 2687.92] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 2693.20- 2697.88] MEE073: right well yeah yeah
[ 2693.26- 2696.72] FEO072: i for multiple terms we can just do something really simple i mean
[ 2697.24- 2700.00] MEE071: yeah or you could do it and override it by the
[ 2700.00- 2709.76] MEE071: you c you could just ignore the ranking if it does not show up together or you could perhaps you could penalize it you could just put a weight against it
[ 2705.60- 2705.88] MEE073: yeah
[ 2707.56- 2722.32] MEE073: well but you still have to do the search you still have to do the n x t search then no if it does not show up yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well it would not show up on the search results if it if it did not exist together
[ 2712.08- 2719.04] MEE071: yeah you do the n x t search so it does not show up together either disregard it or put a weighting against it so if you how many pairs you get you can
[ 2716.44- 2716.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 2720.28- 2730.00] FEO072: yeah just just just disregard it yeah i mean you you just do it really simply you know you will have the results as before yeah
[ 2721.32- 2723.72] MEE071: yeah so then just next yeah
[ 2724.28- 2724.60] MEE073: yeah
[ 2726.70- 2730.00] MEE073: yeah ok we will have we will have to talk to pernil about this then ok
[ 2729.80- 2730.00] MEE071: yeah
[ 2730.00- 2733.32] FEO072: yeah
[ 2730.00- 2730.98] MEE071: requisition yeah
[ 2730.00- 2739.12] MEE073: cause c o g is doing this good we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but no actually w yeah
[ 2740.24- 2742.16] FEO072: it does not have to be all intelligent
[ 2742.48- 2745.56] MEE073: yeah well that is certainly yeah that is true
[ 2742.86- 2750.08] MEE071: cause some things you are going to get a lot of results or and if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom and it was actually the most relevant one something like that would just push it up
[ 2745.04- 2745.84] FEO072: yeah that is true
[ 2748.78- 2760.00] MEE073: well that is also i mean if it is well yeah yeah ok c o g makes and then we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that would get returned if there were fifteen meetings at like
[ 2760.00- 2766.24] MEE073: languages in and it is going to show you those and rank them as to which is the highest ok ok i see that
[ 2762.82- 2780.76] MEE071: yeah it is just the highest and also with something like sunny day the if sunny and day are not mentioned together a lot but sunny to have expressions once that its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them if you just add them together
[ 2779.60- 2790.00] MEE073: well the thing is i mean that will be exactly how we are doing it now like we are just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document if they do then there is a possibility that they occur together and then we do the only
[ 2790.00- 2791.12] MEE073: cause you search on that document
[ 2791.24- 2807.98] MEE071: yeah yeah but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something is having an amazing highly ranked thing from t f i v f it could just ignore them because it falls off the bottom of the do you i am assuming you only you have a c do you s you return all results for all say you type language and it returns seventy five meetings
[ 2793.18- 2793.72] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 2808.20- 2817.72] MEE073: well right now it is not doing anything so i do not i do not know what dwayne is doing but yeah yeah yeah i think so yeah
[ 2811.44- 2818.20] FEO072: well it is not that many meetings i mean it is a production is there really wow oh
[ 2813.24- 2816.76] MEE071: yeah there are only seventy but there are seventy five meeting yeah yeah
[ 2819.20- 2819.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 2820.00- 2831.90] MEE071: so if it so yeah if you return seventy five why where do you stop or how do you rank them or something or if it turns twenty even if it turns twenty do you cut it off at ten do you rank them d what is the threshold to rank them that would be
[ 2825.76- 2829.86] MEE073: yeah yeah yeah that is true ok
[ 2831.54- 2832.56] FEO072: yeah that is true
[ 2832.24- 2837.52] MEE073: yeah we could through them all yeah
[ 2834.40- 2836.62] MEE071: obviously the more we went out of time then
[ 2836.12- 2845.42] FEO072: it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them but you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow
[ 2846.80- 2847.02] MEE073: yeah
[ 2849.34- 2850.00] FEO072: you know you still
[ 2850.00- 2852.08] FEO072: want to be able to search for for the word language
[ 2854.10- 2854.98] FEO072: in a sensible way
[ 2858.50- 2860.22] FEO072: we will discuss it again on friday
[ 2866.76- 2867.20] MEE071: yeah
[ 2874.88- 2875.36] MEE071: so is that it

[  150.00-  173.40] MEE073: that was the main thing so as soon as that is in it will be ready i was making a couple little changes as well so so those will be able to play with still working on the trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well so that is that is sorted tonight as well so yeah other than that it is sorta coming along getting a better feel for all these night objects
[  173.26-  175.94] FEO072: yeah
[  173.80-  179.16] MEE071: yeah

[  178.30-  178.88] FEO072: yeah
[  180.00-  193.66] MEE073: i know it is it is like if you are going to use this stuff later on in your life then you spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it is like ok what is the minimum i can not get away with you get me what we need so it is like i do not know unless i want to do something with this in the future
[  187.02-  191.50] FEO072: yeah
[  187.48-  190.80] MEE071: yeah

[  215.94-  217.00] FEO070: i
[  224.10-  232.72] MEE071: does not have anything you know have anything it does it has about three lines of x m l that does not do much of that yeah what is that
[  225.48-  226.44] MEE073: oh really ok
[  228.10-  230.08] FEO072: ok yeah that is right yeah
[  228.62-  238.56] MEE073: ok ok ok yeah cause i saw it again today i was just so yeah i think that was me i think so the del yeah that was that was sure
[  233.80-  235.00] FEO072: oh right well
[  236.20-  240.00] FEO072: do you just kind of remove that just just pull nice things
[  240.00-  240.48] FEO072: ok
[  240.32-  241.68] MEE073: yeah
[  240.58-  244.20] MEE071: it just seems to be occupied in space it is alright does not matter we have as many
[  244.04-  247.14] MEE073: giving false impressions of what is happening when something is going on
[  245.98-  266.56] MEE071: yeah i had lots of stuff in there yesterday did you see lots of stuff i know they live there but there is i had even more stuff there yesterday i was unzipping all these kinda crazy huge things that were in the walls i needed them they were for this though it is alright
[  248.80-  253.32] MEE073: yeah that is something all those objects
[  249.96-  254.52] FEO070: it is a lot of stuff in there yeah
[  250.12-  256.60] FEO072: yeah yeah
[  261.12-  270.00] MEE073: right how is your quote on that what do you actually do you know how much we have yeah ok so we probably will not have to worry about it yeah
[  264.20-  268.60] FEO072: yeah it is huge it is a small gig i think
[  268.82-  270.00] FEO070: yeah
[  270.00-  274.88] FEO070: should run the aisle there is no way to yeah
[  270.00-  274.40] MEE073: yeah
[  270.76-  279.82] MEE071: yeah it is just about yeah it is i think it is about eight gigs on there so yeah it is just much bigger than all of our home owners who still are is not it so yeah
[  273.66-  274.88] FEO072: yeah
[  276.76-  279.02] MEE073: yeah exactly
[  280.24-  282.36] MEE073: how is everything else going
[  280.80-  281.32] FEO070: ok
[  282.44-  284.56] FEO072: has anyone had time to to play with it
[  285.08-  292.68] MEE071: yeah i had a play with it yesterday no it was good really yeah that was it
[  286.76-  287.04] FEO070: ok
[  288.40-  289.16] FEO072: any comments
[  296.00-  300.00] MEE071: it generated a lot of exceptions in the background
[  299.04-  300.00] MEE073: oh yeah
[  300.00-  301.96] MEE071: but that did not cause any problems but it just
[  300.00-  300.14] MEE073: actually
[  301.88-  313.28] MEE073: do we want to keep that like are we keeping that how that happens it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like as it does everything it just kinda i guess that is its default behavior right so it is just kinda does not really do anything so ok
[  302.10-  302.50] FEO072: oh right
[  310.12-  326.92] FEO072: might as well yeah i mean yeah the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago there is still this one error which is a bug in in n x t and that r always generates these i think when you when you left click or right click or something i can not remember now
[  320.20-  320.78] MEE073: oh right
[  328.36-  330.00] FEO072: but if
[  330.00-  338.20] FEO072: if it is a real error then it it stops so you can not make any oh yeah good good good good
[  332.80-  347.84] MEE071: yeah i did not discover any of those yeah i did have a look i prodded it to see if it would break though it did not break too i did not play that long but it seemed all right really yeah and the the the the start up screen it has gone again it is all right yeah
[  335.52-  338.76] MEE073: yeah
[  335.90-  338.40] FEO070: good
[  344.02-  344.36] MEE073: yeah
[  347.04-  347.30] FEO072: yeah
[  347.80-  357.16] MEE073: yeah i was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what i was doing so i did not did not take it for a full test drive yet but you can do that that is quite quite effort yes
[  352.20-  352.56] FEO072: ok
[  355.56-  360.00] FEO072: yeah it would be good is there any any comments you have about just like wording
[  356.44-  357.84] FEO070: is there any
[  360.00-  362.28] FEO072: and or some sort of minor things
[  362.92-  371.12] MEE071: no it looks alright the only the only thing is the it is not the start up screen is not too pretty but the it does not look at it
[  363.48-  363.68] FEO072: yeah
[  369.32-  382.48] FEO072: yeah at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty tall but you know i would make them a bit nicer if i had more time but at the moment it does not look like that so i will if
[  369.48-  371.16] MEE073: a lot of this java stuff is up there
[  380.20-  383.52] MEE071: no it is not it is not it is not it is not the it is not the top priority is it
[  381.84-  388.00] MEE073: if you if you change a window manager it might look a little bit nicer oh yeah not camera
[  385.28-  390.00] MEE071: yeah i think it would look better on windows as well actually cause java uses the native windows that are
[  390.00-  390.64] MEE071: does not it so
[  390.80-  391.04] MEE073: yeah
[  391.80-  392.12] MEE071: yeah
[  392.80-  397.78] MEE073: yeah actually can we run it on windows
[  393.44-  394.14] MEE071: and we do it
[  395.18-  397.84] MEE071: yeah
[  395.44-  399.38] FEO070: moven
[  397.16-  406.10] FEO072: but that took me so long to the first blue start window so i am quite glad that it looks you know n nice on one row and all this kind of thing
[  400.98-  401.90] MEE071: to the
[  401.20-  402.60] MEE073: ok yeah
[  405.88-  408.80] MEE073: were you using like a gui builder or just all from a card
[  408.26-  409.68] FEO072: no this is just yeah
[  410.16-  410.90] MEE073: ok and that is
[  413.10-  414.92] MEE073: that is nasty
[  414.80-  418.96] MEE071: well the the the this big characterization is finished
[  418.92-  420.00] MEE073: ok
[  419.86-  420.00] FEO072: oh
[  420.00-  420.18] FEO072: right
[  420.00-  420.62] MEE073: right ok
[  420.28-  431.26] MEE071: i have not done it i have not updated all those object faster though cause it takes ages on these computers so i do it it is faster for some bizarre reason if i log in at home and then run the code it runs in much faster than anyone doing it here
[  420.40-  420.72] FEO070: kay
[  431.12-  432.80] FEO072: that is quality
[  432.76-  436.40] MEE071: wait it does it does can not work to sit in the lab and wait half an hour or whatever it takes me
[  434.48-  442.20] MEE073: can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there and then you can see it is
[  438.74-  448.28] MEE071: yeah no that is right there really speed it up yeah
[  442.20-  445.20] MEE073: i have done some like that before it is insane
[  445.20-  449.92] MEE073: it is insane
[  450.00-  459.22] FEO072: yeah i started i started using your the speaker i do not know if you have seen that in the yeah
[  450.00-  453.36] MEE073: yeah
[  458.40-  467.16] MEE071: i saw that yeah i saw that it it that it tells tells you what speakers are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah something like that yeah
[  466.94-  472.76] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah but it is good your your stuff is really go good it has got a good interface and easy to use it is nice
[  473.22-  480.00] MEE071: yeah the the the dialog acts are all done in their car i am using some of them but there are some of them some of them
[  480.00-  501.20] MEE071: of the the thing actually what i wanted to talk about dialog acts was there are some that occur all the time that are just and i do not know how interesting there are so the fir one statement is that it will b i removed it cause it was like everything is prefixed by statement every single dialog act starts with statement and so everybody is top dialog act statement so
[  488.32-  488.64] MEE073: yeah
[  496.78-  497.02] FEO072: right
[  500.44-  500.62] MEE073: right
[  500.86-  503.68] FEO072: well we do not what we include that in there ok
[  502.44-  509.52] MEE071: so i got rid of that and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel well i do not know what that means who knows what was back channel
[  508.22-  508.56] MEE073: what was it
[  509.84-  510.00] FEO072: is we
[  510.00-  511.84] FEO072: there is a yeah
[  512.10-  515.78] MEE071: is that what that means oh we will keep that then and then the other so
[  512.60-  512.76] FEO072: yeah
[  513.68-  513.90] FEO070: yeah
[  515.20-  518.68] FEO072: i do not know if that is very useful because everyone does it it is very
[  515.60-  517.84] MEE073: well it is kind of boring yeah exactly
[  518.66-  535.72] MEE071: yeah some people do not know there are some people who do not do that actually yeah you can see that they do not do that and there is the bottom of their list yeah and some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions what else come up
[  520.80-  521.16] FEO072: really
[  523.92-  527.32] FEO072: the asleep i think
[  527.68-  528.64] FEO070: that is not a great point
[  535.28-  540.00] FEO072: so which w you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to like
[  540.00-  541.42] FEO072: is like three forms ok
[  540.68-  570.00] MEE071: yeah well that is the thing that is why i wanted to know whether or not we cause at the moment you can get there is a method that will just give you the top five for or the top x so you give it any number and it will give you the top whatever for each person and then each meeting knows about all the different dialog acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred and we will give you that in top order as well or we will give you or you can just search for each specific dialog act that you have to search on in b s and k s or
[  549.12-  549.80] MEE073: yeah cool
[  549.98-  550.44] FEO072: great
[  570.00-  579.68] MEE071: than real words i do not know but i could change that so i do not know what we want to display that is what i am that is what i am asking you really
[  577.60-  587.84] MEE073: yeah if we or i know if we have like a a choice so they can filter those out the the top most common just say ok well show all or show you know only in interesting ones
[  587.06-  589.20] MEE071: all is a lot all is like twenty five
[  589.92-  590.16] MEE073: yeah
[  590.20-  590.46] FEO072: but
[  590.98-  592.76] MEE071: direct
[  591.48-  596.78] FEO072: i mean do we do we care if you know why do not w i think you know it would be it would be difficult
[  593.20-  597.32] MEE073: yeah i do not know that does not really matter well if we just automatically filter these out
[  597.82-  600.00] FEO072: but it would be difficult if you know
[  600.00-  612.06] FEO072: if in the speaker characterization window we had a heading you know top five dialog acts and then the little brackets but they are not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
[  612.12-  629.26] MEE071: i think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker has got top a top whatever and so just say one of the boxes just explains this is my top five dialog backs for the speaker and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker is top dialog backs
[  612.16-  613.04] MEE073: no point
[  613.54-  613.88] FEO072: because
[  621.32-  622.60] FEO072: for the speaker yep
[  630.64-  633.24] MEE071: either of those would do you but it would start to take up a lot of space and you do not know
[  633.16-  635.12] FEO072: no i would not yeah
[  635.42-  649.80] MEE071: well you could have no you do not need that so it is cause it is cause it is a speaker window the speaker characterization window comes up so you have got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting and then the top five in that meet in global top five this meeting and then the rest is obvious is not it yeah
[  639.20-  640.00] FEO072: exactly yeah
[  643.52-  644.82] FEO072: yeah yeah
[  645.96-  647.70] FEO072: yeah
[  647.12-  647.28] MEE073: yeah
[  649.08-  649.28] MEE073: yeah
[  649.96-  654.00] FEO072: yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another
[  655.12-  660.00] FEO072: but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones
[  660.00-  661.20] FEO072: and then
[  660.48-  660.86] MEE071: do ok
[  662.56-  690.00] MEE071: but it some often the interesting ones do not occur things like joke do not occur very often well they do sometimes but they are not they are common one guy has top five joke one of them is joke he is an undergrad that is why yeah
[  673.00-  678.32] FEO070: oh yeah
[  675.44-  678.28] FEO072: you follow those on
[  677.36-  685.48] MEE073: right actually yeah this is good for browsing though it is perfect i mean that is sort of exactly what he wanted to do and it was the big thing exactly yeah he was doing one
[  684.28-  685.04] FEO070: yeah
[  685.36-  687.52] FEO072: yeah so that is what speaker calculation gives me
[  687.50-  688.90] MEE073: exactly it is fine
[  689.20-  690.00] FEO070: who is the one
[  689.32-  690.00] FEO072: who is the one
[  690.00-  702.88] FEO070: interested in this guy cause he is used to be funny yeah
[  692.72-  704.08] MEE071: yeah yeah yeah yeah it is taking the next joke yeah that would be quite good
[  693.08-  702.02] MEE073: yeah yeah it is taking the next joke that would be quite good
[  693.68-  694.16] FEO072: yeah
[  696.90-  720.00] FEO072: yeah yeah so is is this percentage then if you say like joke for this speaker is percentage i dunno twenty is that the h what percentage of his speech is joke or
[  715.16-  715.50] MEE071: yeah
[  720.00-  722.32] FEO072: i what what percentage of the jokes
[  720.44-  728.72] MEE071: what percentage to the dialog acts that he makes are jokes in the meeting and globally separately so one discovery yeah
[  723.90-  726.66] FEO072: the jokes yeah yep
[  727.80-  728.16] FEO072: ok
[  730.56-  737.90] MEE071: i think most things are coded with a dialog act a lot of them are coded with z which means no label so i just ignored that as well because it is boring
[  736.64-  736.84] FEO072: yeah
[  739.46-  750.00] MEE071: and statement which is boring and also the other thing that they have is if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that so they put they put the the dialog act and then they put
[  750.00-  764.04] MEE071: a diva a color and then they put that outside i just ignored any any quoting material cause it is kind of nothing to do with just yeah yeah somebody else is joking so you have to be original about your material or it is about creativity
[  752.60-  756.42] MEE073: ok yeah well it is not a real joke anyways
[  753.44-  753.94] FEO072: yeah
[  760.10-  767.44] FEO072: yeah yeah i mean just keep it as simple as
[  767.80-  768.04] MEE073: yeah
[  768.12-  769.68] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  771.16-  778.28] MEE073: ok that is untrue so that is sort of implemented now or is that the first plus file super ok that is not
[  774.22-  775.60] MEE071: yeah that is what i mean about that yeah
[  776.72-  780.00] MEE071: yeah i just did i just finished
[  780.00-  786.82] MEE071: there might be some pushing i can not remember but i think it is pretty much complete so i will do that tonight just put it out there so you can start using that
[  782.98-  783.44] MEE073: yeah
[  785.04-  803.66] MEE073: ok and when apt i find i will just recompile the m browsers and then just get that yeah well so it will uses my part as well the m search yeah actually do we have like naming convention for s our source files just prefix em with an m and you know
[  791.48-  792.40] FEO072: you will yeah
[  794.80-  794.92] FEO072: yeah
[  796.56-  797.00] FEO072: sounds good
[  802.98-  806.36] FEO072: yeah i was thinking that it sort of turned out that way a bit did not it
[  805.78-  810.00] MEE073: yeah yeah that is sort of what i was doing it like for your stuff do you have
[  809.40-  810.00] MEE071: no i just
[  810.00-  813.62] MEE071: what is called meeting and speaker well i can change it if you want
[  810.00-  810.24] MEE073: no
[  811.64-  812.48] MEE073: ok yeah
[  813.68-  818.76] MEE073: it does not matter no it does not matter at this point no just kind of curious and thinking about future stuff maybe
[  813.92-  815.02] FEO072: i do not know if you are not
[  815.52-  815.92] MEE071: no
[  817.20-  817.76] FEO072: oh i was
[  818.64-  820.72] MEE071: we could put it in a in a package
[  820.92-  821.64] MEE073: yeah that is true too
[  821.80-  822.58] MEE071: if you be bothered
[  822.82-  824.06] MEE073: yeah yeah does not matter
[  824.10-  833.72] MEE071: well it does not seem to make any difference i have never ever used japan packages it does not mean we either if it is not just in the same directory it works so it is all the end but
[  827.70-  829.66] MEE073: yeah it does not matter
[  831.52-  831.68] MEE073: yeah
[  831.78-  832.12] FEO072: right
[  834.36-  834.64] MEE073: ok
[  836.04-  840.00] FEO072: i have one one one little question that i reckon we should have a
[  840.00-  841.56] FEO072: little icon for a browser
[  842.88-  848.28] MEE071: what you can double click on a minute oh oh oh i know
[  844.58-  855.48] FEO072: well no i think it is in yeah in the top left at the moment they have got an x which is you know n x t and it is sort of a bit cheeky to use that so
[  846.66-  848.62] FEO070: yeah yeah the top left yeah
[  849.66-  850.74] MEE073: oh yeah
[  853.42-  857.36] MEE071: yeah we have something else just borrow a little microsoft gif like that
[  857.20-  858.80] MEE073: yeah right
[  857.70-  869.72] FEO072: no we meant something original what do we suggest the only thing i could think of was an m the
[  860.92-  867.32] FEO070: what do you
[  868.48-  869.88] MEE073: yeah i know yeah same name
[  871.74-  872.40] MEE071: a bee
[  871.92-  892.24] FEO070: we have a big yellow end in we no it would be soo for that no yeah yeah that would be good
[  874.84-  878.84] MEE071: yeah where have i seen that before
[  876.18-  878.84] MEE073: oh nice
[  879.76-  881.08] FEO072: you would be sued for that in any way
[  880.88-  887.00] MEE073: super size meeting browser
[  882.62-  883.98] FEO072: yeah
[  882.80-  887.64] MEE071: yeah
[  888.44-  888.88] MEE073: yeah
[  892.58-  898.24] MEE073: just probably basic just text font and just something nice something solid maybe maybe
[  896.56-  896.96] FEO072: yeah
[  897.52-  898.72] MEE071: yeah anybody can like to think
[  898.64-  900.00] FEO072: i mean it is tiny so we can not really
[  900.00-  904.00] FEO072: put more than one character really or one sort of simple yeah
[  901.32-  902.02] MEE073: exactly
[  903.76-  909.90] MEE073: any anybody have any artistic talent no no
[  908.92-  910.64] FEO072: yeah well i can d
[  909.54-  922.28] MEE071: do you think you would be doing m s c is in informatics and we can
[  909.94-  910.16] FEO070: no
[  911.76-  923.04] MEE073: yeah yeah it is possible some people are balanced some people are not some balanced people alright maybe i will check see if i can find any
[  912.78-  921.82] FEO072: yeah
[  923.26-  925.12] FEO072: well if you find anything then send it to me
[  925.24-  925.54] MEE073: ok
[  926.24-  927.86] FEO072: otherwise i will i will make up some m
[  928.06-  930.00] MEE073: how do you add that to the
[  930.00-  934.92] MEE073: to the java program is it just basic little ok ok
[  932.22-  934.60] FEO072: i am not sure actually
[  933.52-  941.30] MEE071: it is really easy you do it in one of the whatever the main window is you do set gif or some set set set picture or something you need to
[  939.78-  940.10] MEE073: oh
[  940.06-  946.90] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it there but i will have to import it somehow or not quite sure
[  942.86-  945.00] MEE073: so just in the main frame ok ok yeah
[  946.88-  947.28] MEE073: ok
[  947.24-  949.88] MEE071: yeah i think you just give it a file name and it tells it you know
[  949.12-  950.78] FEO072: yeah
[  950.16-  954.06] MEE073: also it will do the automatic scrunching down if it is possible oh nice super
[  951.98-  955.00] MEE071: yeah yeah just sticks it in the corners yeah yeah
[  954.56-  960.00] FEO070: we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how did the give
[  960.00-  963.18] FEO070: improve your browsing
[  961.56-  964.18] FEO072: yes
[  961.86-  965.16] MEE071: yeah
[  964.32-  967.32] MEE073: you know it is a distincting s distinctive experience i guess yeah
[  966.98-  968.92] FEO072: oh yes
[  968.62-  978.32] MEE071: you will even have some sound when it comes on and go welcome to the meeting no that is problem have to do it in the
[  970.92-  976.48] FEO072: no no
[  972.76-  973.12] MEE073: yeah
[  974.52-  984.36] MEE073: can we get sound on these machines question actually have you ever managed oh yeah you must oh yeah i have got play any sort of music on the dice machines right ok
[  983.16-  987.00] MEE071: no no but i think if you put headphones in it will just play just normal
[  986.76-  990.00] MEE073: oh right right i will have them on the front too ok yeah
[  987.56-  987.96] FEO072: if
[  989.36-  990.00] FEO072: if the
[  990.00-  998.10] FEO072: sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to reboot and sometimes it does not work yeah
[  992.72-  994.84] MEE073: yeah ok right
[  993.04-  994.64] MEE071: yeah yeah
[  998.00-  998.22] MEE073: right
[  998.42-  999.52] MEE071: sometimes it makes sense
[ 1000.24- 1006.48] FEO070: i guess that is why we have a separate speech lab yeah
[ 1002.54- 1004.24] MEE071: yeah
[ 1002.54- 1012.48] MEE073: yes yeah get a lot of audio ok ok well this this looks good
[ 1010.82- 1012.96] FEO070: yeah yeah
[ 1014.46- 1020.00] FEO070: i am running some troubles with the indexing but found another package like
[ 1020.00- 1027.76] FEO070: instead of writing it from scratch cause it is all i do not know just now but i have not pulled around it much but
[ 1030.36- 1034.24] FEO070: we will see what happens in the next few days
[ 1031.38- 1031.68] MEE073: yeah
[ 1033.14- 1037.78] MEE073: and we are going to be you know trying to get the output from that and i dunno still have not found out if it is
[ 1039.00- 1050.00] MEE073: feasible to open up more than one well as many n n objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were going to like figured that the ranking did make sense like to be looking through the highest ranked the one
[ 1040.86- 1042.32] FEO070: yeah i think about that
[ 1050.00- 1058.92] MEE073: ones first so if we are going to look through only five of them just pick the top five to to do the the search and since that is probably what we are looking for anyways
[ 1059.68- 1061.40] FEO070: i guess not true right now like
[ 1061.24- 1061.46] MEE073: yeah
[ 1065.76- 1074.44] MEE071: i still can not make it run t and t from general yeah you try you can make it work there will not you well chopped
[ 1065.90- 1066.42] FEO070: see
[ 1068.22- 1079.88] MEE073: are you serious maybe i will try yeah yeah and that would be a surprise cause i am bad at joe
[ 1073.18- 1073.68] FEO070: ok
[ 1080.30- 1091.76] FEO070: yeah i did not expect this course to be so much about java but it feels like it is it is a java course but not maybe else it is just like
[ 1083.84- 1084.62] MEE073: yeah sure
[ 1088.04- 1092.68] MEE071: it is a job of course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[ 1089.64- 1089.98] FEO072: yeah
[ 1090.04- 1093.00] MEE073: yeah a c practical job i do not know
[ 1091.84- 1097.36] FEO072: in fact it is a n x t package yeah yeah
[ 1095.00- 1100.22] MEE073: yeah how do you guys find the documentation for n x t yeah
[ 1095.56- 1096.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 1096.00- 1096.94] MEE071: co let us see
[ 1100.38- 1103.36] MEE071: rubbish
[ 1101.46- 1102.32] FEO072: yeah
[ 1101.62- 1104.40] MEE073: yeah exactly that is my point as well
[ 1103.72- 1110.00] FEO072: i mean sometimes they have methods that do not have any explanation to it at all so you are just like right i will try this
[ 1108.00- 1108.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 1108.36- 1109.12] MEE071: yeah i think it was
[ 1110.00- 1114.26] FEO072: this then and see what i need to be
[ 1110.60- 1122.32] MEE071: so windows yeah and then it is was plainly generated by going to generate java doc and just went sped it all out and then went to where
[ 1112.10- 1113.44] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 1121.04- 1125.92] MEE073: yeah ok well it is still i guess research platform
[ 1125.06- 1129.44] MEE071: yeah it is it is good to know what methods are there so without having to look at the source going to
[ 1127.54- 1127.82] MEE073: yeah
[ 1129.12- 1132.36] MEE073: yeah that is true ok i am just curious
[ 1131.22- 1131.62] MEE071: i am just
[ 1132.68- 1133.70] MEE071: this is it yeah yeah
[ 1138.48- 1139.16] FEO070: so
[ 1138.84- 1140.00] MEE073: so did we have a
[ 1140.00- 1159.32] MEE073: a date for when we actually want the system done i thought we should i thought we would yeah i thought we would change it to the tenth or something cause the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh oh oh we should do should i should do
[ 1143.80- 1144.20] FEO072: friday
[ 1144.42- 1146.80] MEE071: today was not it
[ 1145.94- 1146.96] FEO072: i thought it was pretty
[ 1146.52- 1150.78] FEO070: we change it to friday yeah we can change it to the tenth or something
[ 1149.76- 1151.52] MEE071: ok
[ 1152.00- 1152.88] FEO070: i think it is nice
[ 1161.04- 1169.32] MEE073: so i dunno do we want to set an actual hard deadline or like d when exactly were we going to start the evaluation
[ 1165.64- 1167.00] FEO072: yeah yeah
[ 1169.32- 1170.00] FEO072: well that is the
[ 1170.00- 1174.16] FEO072: problem because steve has not given us any details has he
[ 1173.60- 1190.60] MEE073: yeah ok well we yeah i guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah come up with scenarios that sort of thing i mean that is that is fairly straightforward and could actually be fun yeah exactly that is true just brainstorm yeah yeah
[ 1180.44- 1181.20] FEO072: that is true
[ 1184.88- 1186.80] FEO072: i i am sure we could do that in like a meeting
[ 1187.98- 1189.88] FEO072: and make it up to j yeah
[ 1193.08- 1200.00] FEO072: the thing is yeah we had the the deadline last friday but we will not be able to do an evaluation during the weekend
[ 1193.36- 1193.80] FEO070: yeah
[ 1200.00- 1203.12] FEO072: anyway so i think we could say monday
[ 1200.24- 1201.80] FEO070: no so we can
[ 1200.64- 1201.40] MEE073: yeah that is true yeah
[ 1203.08- 1207.64] FEO070: yeah does not cause yeah yeah that is friday
[ 1203.20- 1203.52] MEE073: yeah
[ 1205.40- 1205.70] MEE073: no t
[ 1205.88- 1207.28] FEO072: and that would give us a whole weekend
[ 1207.72- 1218.02] MEE073: to work on it as well yeah yeah i have i have got my d n l g presentation on monday do not have to read the paper

[ 1226.12- 1227.72] FEO070: shall we make it up monday
[ 1228.76- 1229.26] FEO070: or
[ 1231.32- 1235.10] MEE073: we will probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess but
[ 1232.08- 1232.48] FEO070: sure you
[ 1233.84- 1234.20] FEO070: yeah
[ 1235.80- 1237.34] FEO070: just like
[ 1236.76- 1247.56] MEE073: we will probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him like we could send him an email but i do not know if he is around do you know he is out around this week is he or i think that is why we did not have the meeting
[ 1241.52- 1242.64] FEO070: yeah just
[ 1245.04- 1246.30] FEO072: i do not know i think it was
[ 1246.30- 1249.00] MEE071: yeah maybe it is just a day and then
[ 1249.00- 1249.44] FEO072: yeah
[ 1249.38- 1250.04] MEE073: right ok
[ 1249.70- 1250.00] FEO070: yeah
[ 1250.12- 1252.00] MEE071: send an email probably read the many emails
[ 1251.80- 1257.70] MEE073: yeah that is true although do we really want the answer so if we do not ask we can push it off and
[ 1254.80- 1255.96] FEO070: yeah
[ 1255.44- 1260.00] FEO072: yeah exactly yeah at the end we will say you well you never gave
[ 1257.88- 1258.22] FEO070: yeah
[ 1260.00- 1261.96] FEO072: just only test subjects
[ 1260.30- 1262.20] MEE073: yeah
[ 1261.92- 1262.36] MEE071: yeah
[ 1262.28- 1265.24] FEO070: what so he is supposed to give us test subject for you to
[ 1264.38- 1273.92] FEO072: well sort of that is how i understood it he would he would make something up yeah find some people that is how i understood it the thing is you know
[ 1265.64- 1267.08] MEE071: he said he might he would try
[ 1268.80- 1269.16] FEO070: ok
[ 1270.12- 1273.08] MEE073: yeah yeah yeah that is
[ 1272.12- 1272.48] MEE071: yeah
[ 1273.68- 1282.12] FEO070: cause we are going to even get an email on our m s c list to proceed we think about it yeah
[ 1276.66- 1279.16] MEE073: right yeah we are looking for volunteers
[ 1279.56- 1290.00] FEO072: yeah i think if we if we do not get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
[ 1281.16- 1281.44] MEE073: right
[ 1290.12- 1290.28] FEO070: yeah
[ 1290.36- 1293.46] MEE073: yeah if they have time it is hard finding people
[ 1293.82- 1308.50] FEO070: well th they are going to u need they are not they are going to need a like perception projects and things like that so yeah so we need we need them to be half an hour maybe we need to use each other
[ 1294.26- 1294.54] MEE071: right
[ 1295.40- 1297.70] FEO072: well they are your friends so they should
[ 1296.74- 1298.22] MEE073: yeah i yeah i know but
[ 1299.96- 1305.32] MEE073: yeah yeah that is true yeah that is true yeah yeah
[ 1300.84- 1303.88] FEO072: it is not going to take long so they need it it is not going to be half an hour maybe
[ 1306.48- 1306.84] FEO072: yeah
[ 1308.66- 1320.00] MEE073: yeah actually some other friends of mine in different programs might might be more willing have more of a break so that would be an idea get a range of types of people as well like not like hire you computer with like
[ 1312.58- 1316.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 1318.48- 1320.00] FEO072: maybe yeah
[ 1320.00- 1323.02] FEO072: well there will be a new there will have to be new
[ 1320.00- 1327.50] MEE073: not you know let ex literate or yeah i think that might be good as well instead of wider range of people
[ 1326.56- 1327.18] FEO072: so
[ 1327.52- 1329.88] MEE071: c how many people are we here to try and cause
[ 1329.50- 1350.00] MEE073: cause i am thinking like three or four maybe that would be a good yeah i think that no i think that is not not yeah exactly like the thing what did an e t i course a while ago i mean it says let us put these you know there is three people yeah and that was fine then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three
[ 1331.52- 1333.58] MEE071: yeah yeah
[ 1332.64- 1336.68] FEO072: really i was thinking of like ten or fifteen
[ 1335.28- 1340.88] MEE071: no let us say forever and then you got to analyze the results no no no no forget
[ 1339.56- 1340.04] FEO072: ok
[ 1345.96- 1346.30] FEO072: really
[ 1350.00- 1355.72] MEE073: people yeah yeah oh yeah we do not want to
[ 1351.02- 1351.48] FEO072: really
[ 1351.92- 1352.12] FEO070: yeah
[ 1354.92- 1357.00] FEO072: how can i get a range of people if you have three
[ 1357.06- 1369.40] MEE071: you have one confused artist and one and one dude off the street yeah
[ 1358.76- 1378.10] FEO070: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah one is supposed to be a woman that must be a man and one oh yeah maybe we should just have two yeah yeah but
[ 1358.88- 1380.00] MEE073: yeah yeah exactly visible messages two and four and one will be right but yeah if he finds them then that is cool if
[ 1359.42- 1360.56] FEO072: one often
[ 1362.76- 1365.92] FEO072: yeah and then once plus three women
[ 1368.60- 1377.36] FEO072: yeah maybe we should just have two
[ 1372.84- 1374.90] MEE071: one man one woman yeah two or four
[ 1379.84- 1380.00] FEO070: oh yeah
[ 1380.00- 1380.20] FEO070: sh
[ 1380.00- 1382.04] MEE073: defines people
[ 1383.06- 1392.84] FEO072: another thing we have the we have the the presentation on like in one and half weeks or something whatever it is or nearly two weeks
[ 1383.48- 1384.36] FEO070: sh
[ 1385.16- 1385.78] MEE073: oh right
[ 1391.56- 1391.78] FEO070: yeah
[ 1392.02- 1392.72] MEE073: exactly
[ 1393.60- 1395.38] FEO070: yeah it is tuesday twenty second
[ 1394.16- 1396.76] MEE071: two weeks two two two two weeks today
[ 1394.70- 1400.32] FEO072: oh it is two yeah it is two weeks then do we have to have done the evaluation by then
[ 1397.10- 1397.26] FEO070: yeah
[ 1397.40- 1397.80] MEE073: ok
[ 1400.88- 1401.10] MEE071: yeah
[ 1401.60- 1402.12] FEO070: ok so
[ 1402.42- 1410.00] MEE073: i thought the evaluation maybe for the report so and that is doing the twenty fifth twenty fifth is is it is it that is
[ 1403.92- 1404.44] FEO070: well
[ 1406.16- 1409.62] MEE071: where is the report handing oh right is that is that the friday
[ 1410.00- 1413.96] FEO070: that is the thursday no thursday yeah so it is not the yeah
[ 1410.00- 1413.00] FEO072: that is the thursday no thursday i think i am just the thursday
[ 1410.00- 1410.80] MEE073: what i understood
[ 1411.18- 1412.48] MEE071: the twenty fourth i think
[ 1412.48- 1438.30] MEE073: i thought you said twi i thought you said twenty f even though it is good for i have been curious about yeah oh yeah the easter or two days no well it was not originally either so yeah yeah ok ok so that gives us two days to do the evaluation no evaluation ok but we
[ 1417.40- 1417.84] MEE071: yeah
[ 1417.76- 1421.38] FEO070: it is not a good friday if that is

[ 1419.40- 1421.14] MEE071: yeah that is a good friday oh yeah
[ 1422.20- 1422.72] FEO072: wow
[ 1422.76- 1425.88] FEO070: it is not a good friday if that is not the day
[ 1423.14- 1423.48] MEE071: yeah
[ 1424.32- 1424.80] FEO072: no
[ 1426.94- 1430.08] FEO072: well i i am sure on the website it says thursday
[ 1427.88- 1428.10] FEO070: no
[ 1432.02- 1432.52] FEO070: ok
[ 1434.58- 1438.28] FEO070: ok no e value
[ 1437.28- 1440.00] FEO072: well you know the the question is i do we need the evaluation
[ 1440.00- 1441.08] FEO072: evaluation for the presentation
[ 1441.98- 1446.44] MEE073: i did not think so necessarily i would not i would not assume but we should ask him
[ 1446.72- 1449.28] FEO072: we should definitely ask him because if not then
[ 1448.42- 1449.24] FEO070: ok
[ 1451.32- 1458.68] MEE071: m well we should have it we should try and have edit done by then anyway i think otherwise it will start getting really tight otherwise
[ 1456.40- 1461.20] MEE073: yeah that is probably it is a good target it is a good yeah
[ 1459.48- 1459.64] FEO070: yeah
[ 1460.56- 1461.74] FEO072: yeah you might be right
[ 1462.48- 1470.00] MEE071: we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming a week no yeah well basically for tuesday start the evaluation
[ 1470.00- 1472.04] MEE071: and to pretty much drive away and then get
[ 1470.92- 1472.04] MEE073: right
[ 1473.64- 1475.40] MEE071: get yeah and then get
[ 1475.22- 1477.50] FEO072: because we need to write a presentation as well
[ 1476.96- 1479.50] MEE071: and we have to write the report yeah and everything we have to write is it
[ 1477.12- 1477.36] MEE073: yeah
[ 1479.02- 1491.02] MEE073: jee it is fun no no it is it is just funny that you know have it finished by monday cause after monday i am pretty much free for about a week or so so it is like if we had not you know a bit more time yeah
[ 1485.26- 1487.72] FEO072: exactly that is the point
[ 1486.70- 1486.94] MEE071: yeah
[ 1489.16- 1495.84] FEO072: yeah yeah well i am not free after this monday but i am free light after the eighteen
[ 1493.04- 1493.48] MEE073: ok
[ 1494.56- 1500.00] MEE073: oh the next month ok yeah yeah i am free this after this monday yes well well what is
[ 1495.60- 1500.00] FEO070: yeah yeah are we free well what if
[ 1500.00- 1500.56] FEO070: be two
[ 1500.00- 1508.90] MEE073: s s b t that is that is easy compared to the most i mean i am not even worried about that yeah yeah ok yeah
[ 1500.22- 1505.18] MEE071: s p t yeah
[ 1502.56- 1507.82] FEO072: because i do not have anything after the eighteenth department yes
[ 1505.68- 1506.22] FEO070: oh i think
[ 1507.80- 1508.08] FEO070: yeah
[ 1508.12- 1520.08] MEE071: and you must have your research proposal is that in only eighteen not done at all yeah
[ 1510.56- 1510.96] MEE073: oh
[ 1510.68- 1513.08] FEO072: well that is in on the eighteenth
[ 1513.78- 1517.64] MEE073: you did not know that yeah how is yours
[ 1517.64- 1517.88] FEO070: yeah
[ 1520.60- 1520.96] MEE073: ok
[ 1522.32- 1523.32] FEO072: so
[ 1522.80- 1527.84] FEO070: yeah but our timeline we were put in the twenty fifth and that is friday i think
[ 1527.00- 1530.00] MEE073: ok maybe that was us then not him
[ 1529.28- 1530.00] FEO070: yeah
[ 1530.00- 1536.22] FEO070: just that is why i am trying to find his his speech feature
[ 1530.00- 1532.92] MEE073: oh oh actually i would have to stop here
[ 1535.70- 1537.58] MEE073: yeah thursday twenty fourth
[ 1540.06- 1541.64] MEE073: deadline per submission final
[ 1540.16- 1542.68] FEO070: we have we have a big party on the twenty fours there
[ 1544.64- 1547.08] MEE073: no well now you can yeah
[ 1545.56- 1547.68] FEO070: end of lectures
[ 1550.26- 1551.46] FEO072: so
[ 1552.08- 1553.80] MEE073: so twenty fourth so if we
[ 1553.38- 1555.36] FEO072: anyone fancy writing them an email
[ 1556.06- 1557.28] FEO070: oh it is actually twenty four
[ 1557.56- 1560.00] MEE073: right just
[ 1560.00- 1563.40] MEE073: to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration or
[ 1563.42- 1565.48] FEO072: that yep and
[ 1566.48- 1568.58] MEE073: we should have it done in the next but ok yes sure
[ 1571.28- 1577.46] MEE073: hopefully but i mean is is that is that a part of the demonstration do they want that information evaluation or
[ 1571.62- 1574.36] FEO072: but it is still important in terms of so
[ 1575.84- 1583.32] FEO072: yeah yeah yeah i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place and
[ 1581.56- 1581.72] MEE073: right
[ 1586.60- 1587.36] FEO072: what was the other one
[ 1588.72- 1590.00] FEO072: basically
[ 1590.00- 1600.18] FEO072: how is how is it going with your evaluation portfolio have you got people yet for us or what are you thinking and when
[ 1595.86- 1596.28] MEE073: oh very
[ 1601.60- 1608.52] FEO070: did he say anything about like what he expects of the final report and stuff like names or
[ 1607.42- 1607.92] FEO072: no
[ 1607.80- 1616.56] MEE073: throw a few little things just made some comments at the last meeting just general like how it all integrates blah blah blah on the screen so yeah
[ 1615.30- 1618.70] FEO072: do we know did you ever say how long it was supposed to be
[ 1619.00- 1620.00] MEE073: no
[ 1620.00- 1622.16] MEE073: i would expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages
[ 1621.80- 1623.64] FEO072: i mean how well
[ 1623.02- 1625.04] FEO070: i mean how long for
[ 1624.06- 1627.68] MEE073: although it is fifty percent of the mark i think is it i think
[ 1627.24- 1627.90] FEO070: i do not know
[ 1627.84- 1631.20] FEO072: but we can write a lot i mean i think we should we should write everything
[ 1629.48- 1629.90] MEE073: yeah
[ 1631.20- 1633.44] MEE073: exactly well we have a bit of time to do the library
[ 1631.44- 1645.18] FEO070: yeah cause this i mean we have interim report of seven pages and that is we could yeah we could probably just expand that
[ 1634.72- 1635.24] MEE073: that will be good
[ 1640.08- 1641.76] FEO072: seven pages yeah
[ 1646.60- 1649.08] FEO070: i mean cause it i mean a lot of it is going to be the same thing
[ 1649.00- 1650.00] MEE073: yeah just
[ 1650.00- 1652.00] MEE073: just to fine tune their detailed and
[ 1650.52- 1650.92] FEO072: true
[ 1651.78- 1658.14] FEO070: yeah and then i mean right about the evala evaluation yeah well that is going to be quite a useful
[ 1653.16- 1653.58] MEE073: watch them
[ 1655.90- 1656.76] FEO072: yeah well that is going to
[ 1657.16- 1660.12] MEE073: yeah that could be yeah that could easily be like five or six pages
[ 1659.16- 1661.12] FEO070: so i do not think
[ 1662.36- 1663.00] FEO072: no actually
[ 1662.60- 1664.72] FEO070: pitcher is going to be
[ 1666.26- 1666.62] MEE073: ok
[ 1666.80- 1667.14] FEO070: yeah
[ 1670.52- 1673.26] FEO072: so do you want to write me an email then that would be good
[ 1672.52- 1672.82] MEE073: sure
[ 1678.50- 1680.00] FEO072: and when i get home today
[ 1680.00- 1682.96] FEO072: which will be before
[ 1686.22- 1691.92] FEO072: before half past six i will make that file readable writable everything
[ 1690.46- 1692.62] MEE073: oh yeah sure yeah no no big brush
[ 1693.18- 1695.06] FEO072: well i i will
[ 1695.00- 1699.52] MEE073: although just to get it out of the way so not trying to remember to do that tomorrow
[ 1699.06- 1706.00] FEO072: well i will i will need your snippets of code or it would be good if i had them by tomorrow evening
[ 1704.28- 1704.54] MEE073: yeah
[ 1706.40- 1706.64] MEE073: yeah
[ 1708.20- 1708.40] MEE073: yeah
[ 1709.36- 1710.00] FEO072: oh i was going to
[ 1710.00- 1711.04] FEO072: ask
[ 1712.88- 1714.34] FEO072: at the moment in your search window
[ 1715.64- 1716.56] FEO072: how is it organized
[ 1717.32- 1725.64] MEE073: just basic pretty much like the interim do you want to do you have the interim stuff just sorta like google type thing and just
[ 1725.08- 1733.96] FEO072: but at the beginning when you have not searched yet is the is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty ok
[ 1731.60- 1732.88] MEE073: yeah yeah
[ 1735.16- 1737.64] MEE073: and as these come up they will just problem with them
[ 1738.82- 1740.00] FEO072: and then if
[ 1740.00- 1741.68] FEO072: if you i do not know double click on one
[ 1742.32- 1750.72] MEE073: it does not do anything yet like that is that is the other big part i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows
[ 1744.58- 1744.86] FEO072: ok
[ 1754.30- 1754.62] FEO072: yeah
[ 1754.60- 1764.84] MEE073: because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics that was why i was sort of deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one
[ 1758.88- 1759.64] FEO072: yeah
[ 1767.00- 1770.00] MEE073: yeah so so there is a couple of those little things that
[ 1768.02- 1770.00] FEO072: well y there is there is the icon by
[ 1770.00- 1773.80] FEO072: the way
[ 1770.00- 1775.28] MEE073: yeah exactly it is beautiful yeah and and makes more sense
[ 1770.74- 1771.10] MEE071: yeah
[ 1775.60- 1784.52] FEO072: yeah maybe you want to do left hand yeah one left click highlights the the result in whatever you have got open
[ 1784.84- 1791.98] MEE073: ok is that how it works in the other ones in like the other windows like the various like if we are in the topic or
[ 1788.04- 1788.46] FEO072: which one
[ 1789.68- 1798.48] FEO072: yeah usually one left click it highlights it cross highlights everything i think yeah
[ 1799.28- 1800.00] MEE073: if you have like a particular
[ 1800.00- 1810.52] MEE073: particular window that you want me to mimic its behavior then like just find it in the program and just say ok just how this one does it so if it is like the topic window or the whatever
[ 1810.08- 1811.82] FEO072: well it is difficult because
[ 1816.64- 1822.68] MEE073: so then i can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring into you so
[ 1816.80- 1817.52] FEO072: well you can look at
[ 1823.48- 1827.96] FEO072: no it is difficult because the the transcription window does cross highlighting
[ 1829.24- 1829.96] FEO072: in a very
[ 1830.00- 1835.84] FEO072: alkward way because it has to find the topic first that was that was a pain
[ 1832.82- 1833.08] MEE073: ok
[ 1837.44- 1853.64] FEO072: and when you when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop topic and and that works when you when you left double click on a topic on a meeting sorry then it loads it
[ 1854.42- 1854.68] MEE073: ok
[ 1854.70- 1855.30] FEO072: so you could
[ 1856.44- 1857.68] FEO072: you could take that for loading
[ 1860.00- 1865.24] FEO072: we have that the same on this one at least that you if you double left click then it loads
[ 1867.24- 1867.60] MEE073: ok
[ 1875.80- 1878.64] MEE073: so one left click just highlights that is what is right
[ 1878.48- 1885.46] FEO072: highlights yeah i mean the hi obviously highlights whatever you have clicked on here but also highlights
[ 1883.00- 1883.96] MEE073: oh just the atom yeah
[ 1885.70- 1886.96] MEE073: the transcript or whatever it is
[ 1888.48- 1889.66] FEO072: actually it is difficult because
[ 1888.86- 1889.08] MEE073: yeah
[ 1893.08- 1893.96] FEO070: very nice
[ 1893.92- 1895.44] MEE073: if you could just
[ 1894.84- 1903.32] FEO072: because you only do not you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be over i well i suppose if you have a if you have a local search then it could cross out like
[ 1895.10- 1896.04] FEO070: you can just show me
[ 1905.72- 1907.84] MEE073: yeah it should be possible
[ 1909.32- 1915.06] FEO072: because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you have only got one meeting open then you can not cross out anything
[ 1909.60- 1909.76] MEE073: yeah
[ 1912.20- 1912.42] MEE073: right
[ 1915.50- 1920.00] MEE073: although yeah this this will this is actually different from how we print it up here like if we are doing an
[ 1920.00- 1950.00] MEE073: global search then we are going to do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms and then we will either you know multi select or you know choose the one we want to actually do this i think multi select would make the most sense we will just if there is like three of the top meetings like like we said before language we are looking for the l word language and get the highest ravey ones to actually look for the terms so we are not loading it out of all seventy six meeting or seventy five other meetings so the the results from that will you know
[ 1926.52- 1926.86] FEO072: ok
[ 1932.68- 1933.96] FEO072: what do you mean multi select
[ 1944.56- 1945.60] FEO072: oh ok
[ 1950.00- 1964.62] MEE073: narrow down what we are going to use for the local search then we will just do the local search on those ones that are chosen and if we can yeah so it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the local search at least yeah
[ 1956.64- 1958.12] FEO072: oh i see what you mean yeah ok
[ 1962.80- 1974.26] FEO072: well i in any case if you left click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight if not it can not so
[ 1972.54- 1975.08] MEE073: yes yes exactly
[ 1985.36- 1985.50] MEE073: ok
[ 1985.56- 1993.96] FEO070: it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries from using that text extractor thing you are like right
[ 1994.96- 2001.42] MEE071: yeah you have to start again just do topics instead of seg yeah you have to get the topics out instead of the segments yeah
[ 1996.32- 1997.94] FEO070: it is like or
[ 2000.66- 2000.92] FEO070: yeah
[ 2003.08- 2007.38] FEO070: i can not just realize i do not have more
[ 2006.16- 2006.74] FEO072: can you make
[ 2007.80- 2010.00] FEO072: is it very difficult to make a
[ 2010.00- 2014.92] FEO072: another another gui but only for a global search
[ 2016.82- 2019.50] MEE073: so that we search two different
[ 2019.30- 2026.50] FEO072: just just take that away the the local check box because
[ 2021.56- 2026.20] MEE073: right yeah that is that is actually fairly
[ 2024.66- 2028.20] FEO070: tile for the startup alright time for the startup
[ 2027.72- 2029.74] FEO072: yeah because in the start of screen you can not have a
[ 2030.16- 2035.96] MEE073: yeah local anyways yeah no that is easy sure yeah that is that is quite straightforward
[ 2032.32- 2039.96] FEO072: yeah would you make that that would be really handy everything else can just stay the same you know in fact you can just leave everything as
[ 2037.78- 2037.96] MEE073: yeah
[ 2040.00- 2041.34] FEO072: it is and just remove the check box
[ 2045.84- 2049.34] FEO072: really well
[ 2046.68- 2049.42] MEE073: yeah so
[ 2049.20- 2051.72] MEE071: so are you going to be able to do a global search for topics
[ 2054.38- 2059.28] FEO070: yeah well there was i like yeah if i would make a just index
[ 2055.68- 2067.54] MEE071: is that what you mean oh yeah exactly ok yeah yeah ok yeah i did not think you would bother with that but yeah cool i did not think we were going to bother with that but yeah it does does not it yeah
[ 2057.10- 2058.94] MEE073: yeah yeah exactly
[ 2062.62- 2062.80] FEO070: what
[ 2064.88- 2067.16] MEE073: well it it kind of sense it is kind of
[ 2065.08- 2069.60] FEO070: well i i mean i it is not first priority maybe but
[ 2069.00- 2070.00] MEE073: sh are we
[ 2069.60- 2069.88] MEE071: oh
[ 2070.00- 2071.16] FEO070: bother
[ 2070.00- 2080.52] MEE073: bothering with our topic stuff still or is that sort of gone like our own topic segment like since we can not do the labeling and all the rest we are still doing our topic segment you are you are
[ 2072.88- 2073.32] MEE071: well we
[ 2079.20- 2084.40] MEE071: well we will certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it yeah at the very least
[ 2082.48- 2099.60] MEE073: but we are not going to be we will not be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they do not have labels probably label all the label ones ok label two is i do not know ok
[ 2083.18- 2083.42] FEO072: yeah
[ 2090.92- 2100.00] MEE071: no yeah yeah yeah do not remember doing that well yeah even
[ 2091.52- 2094.28] FEO070: yeah yeah all the label ones
[ 2100.00- 2107.12] MEE071: if even if i happen to manage to make it do some keywords i do not think we can expect you to also come up with a search for that as well
[ 2105.76- 2110.86] MEE073: yeah k yeah ok well no it will be kind of straightforward like if you are creating if you are creating x m files it is
[ 2108.76- 2130.00] MEE071: well yeah but if i create yeah yeah if i create x m l files whatever i am not going to do that i did have a look at trying to create x m l files it did not look like a button omission really i suppose it is not it is it is as straightforward as writing an x m l file so it is but it is organizing the segment later that it would just look so complicated to get it
[ 2114.30- 2114.60] MEE073: yeah

[  120.00-  150.00] FEE013: you probably already know we want it to be original something that s people have not thought of it is not out in the shops trendy appealing to a wide market but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe even poochies should be able to use it ok first is the functional design this is where we all go off and do our individual work
[  150.00-  160.96] FEE013: what needs need to be fulfilled by the product what effect the product has to have and how it is actually going to do that conceptual design
[  162.32-  167.80] FEE013: what we are thinking how it is going to go and then the detailed design how we are actually going to put it into practice and make it work
[  170.38-  180.00] FEE013: ok right we are going to practice with the pens and draw our favorite animal on the whiteboard i will go first

[  330.00-  351.48] MEO015: on what you are second it is loyal and third thing it is got intuition means dogs can some sometimes make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog

[  465.48-  466.00] MEE014: oh
[  467.94-  468.70] MEE014: ok
[  474.40-  479.36] FEE016: i get a little bit off the top of my head i was going to do it with two
[  476.72-  477.64] MEE014: oh
[  481.26-  484.68] FEE016: it does not look like what i want it to be
[  484.48-  484.72] MEE014: so
[  488.76-  491.40] FEE016: it is not a vampire bat honestly

[  524.32-  528.64] MEE014: yeah yeah an eagle
[  525.50-  525.96] FEE013: eagle
[  541.44-  549.52] FEE016: and very supreme idea intrepid intrepid
[  553.66-  556.76] FEE016: there we go let us throw that pen going to be ok
[  554.48-  555.16] FEE013: that is something
[  558.68-  559.32] FEE016: ok
[  561.12-  561.60] FEE013: ok
[  563.12-  570.00] FEE013: that was fine right finance wise we have got a selling price at twenty five euros
[  570.00-  575.32] FEE013: which i do not actually know what that is in pounds at all any ideas
[  575.12-  577.66] MEE014: so that yeah
[  576.50-  577.20] FEE016: seventy
[  576.76-  581.50] MEO015: like point four yeah point forty o would make a little bomb or something like that
[  580.84-  587.56] MEE014: yeah yeah something like that so yeah about seventeen seventeen pounds something like that
[  582.60-  582.92] MEO015: yeah
[  583.84-  587.98] FEE013: ifteen seventeen ok that is expensive
[  584.88-  585.96] FEE016: seventy
[  588.36-  592.28] FEE016: should we be making notes of this we can just refer to this later come on
[  590.86-  591.20] MEE014: but
[  590.98-  595.92] FEE013: i think so i think so i would be able to pull that up or i could put it in the shared holder or something
[  593.80-  594.28] FEE016: ok
[  594.20-  600.00] MEE014: having having said that though if you want to get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment there is
[  600.00-  608.08] MEE014: they are about twenty pounds anyway so yeah we have to buy one
[  603.52-  604.22] FEE016: right
[  603.88-  604.22] FEE013: really
[  605.84-  606.02] FEE016: so
[  608.08-  613.92] FEE016: so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price we do or or is it going to make our product look a cheapy cheapy option
[  608.12-  608.98] FEE013: so i suppose the
[  613.50-  617.82] FEE013: yeah production costs at twelve fifty so
[  614.08-  614.88] MEE014: yeah
[  617.54-  619.60] MEO015: ok pretty huge margin
[  619.12-  629.36] FEE013: half of the selling price is taken up by building it and profit aim is fifty million euros which is a
[  621.46-  622.16] MEE014: yeah
[  630.36-  631.20] FEE016: in our first year
[  631.28-  637.08] FEE013: yeah yes yeah i presume so
[  638.10-  651.50] FEE016: you have got market range international and you did say earlier it has got to be accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just we are not focusing on business market any particular thing it is everyone user targeted everyone ok
[  649.12-  650.28] FEE013: oh yeah
[  653.40-  655.40] FEE016: big target group
[  653.56-  660.00] FEE013: sorry yes yes i do not think we have to i do not think it is a case of worrying about different
[  660.00-  670.24] FEE013: languages and things like that making that a key point just that it is going to be in the international market like australia america things like that ok
[  661.84-  662.20] FEE016: yeah
[  666.68-  666.96] FEE016: yeah
[  675.20-  690.00] FEE013: what are your experiences with remote controls i mean i have got we got we had three videos a t v and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal
[  687.24-  687.56] MEO015: yeah
[  688.12-  688.44] MEE014: yeah
[  690.00-  704.72] FEE013: remote controls that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we would have to reprogram it every now and again i think it was quite cheapy as well so that might have had something to do with it but that was quite good the fact that you could
[  691.12-  691.88] FEE016: right
[  691.24-  692.12] MEE014: yeah
[  691.48-  692.22] MEO015: yeah that is
[  701.10-  701.88] MEE014: yeah
[  705.18-  706.72] MEE014: use all the ones in the signal
[  705.96-  708.92] FEE013: you did not have six remote controls sitting in front of you
[  708.08-  708.56] FEE016: right
[  708.60-  710.92] MEO015: ok you want to integrate everything into one like
[  711.24-  713.24] MEE014: yeah cause you
[  711.88-  720.00] FEE016: my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy not doing any tampering with it and programming using it to program
[  712.32-  712.72] MEO015: ok
[  720.00-  736.04] FEE016: t v r videos and things but basically on off volume up and down channel one two that basic function i do not think i could go any further with it than that so i suppose it has got to be something usable by someone like me as well
[  734.98-  750.00] FEE013: yeah the main that is the main stuff anyway i mean and you do not want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the tablet
[  737.28-  737.68] FEE016: right
[  747.68-  747.96] MEE014: yeah
[  750.00-  751.76] FEE013: the text button or something like that
[  750.00-  755.28] FEE016: and something like that that you do not necessarily understand symbols you are meant to understand that you do not
[  752.60-  752.96] FEE013: yeah
[  755.18-  758.06] MEO015: just going to make sure so it is going to be
[  757.44-  779.80] FEE013: when they are when you have got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the the other functions when you can do sound or options kind of recording things like that inside it cause it does not make when you pick it up it does not make it really complicated to look at it is obvious what you are doing
[  768.52-  768.98] FEE016: oh yeah
[  777.52-  777.64] FEE016: right
[  777.92-  778.66] MEE014: yeah
[  780.00-  794.48] FEE016: so that just raises a point i wonder what our design people think but you know on a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu it has got a menu display i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you have got a little l c d display
[  787.08-  787.74] MEO015: maybe right
[  792.16-  792.62] MEE014: yeah
[  792.88-  793.44] MEO015: yeah
[  794.46-  810.00] MEO015: right i was thinking on the same lines you instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user may maybe have an l c d l display or something like that like a mobile and with menus and if it is somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse
[  803.80-  805.92] FEE016: with menus yeah
[  810.00-  812.04] MEO015: an nth apple so maybe
[  811.14-  811.48] FEE016: yeah
[  812.36-  815.08] FEE013: what about the older generation what about granny and grandad s
[  816.16-  823.64] FEE013: my grandad can answer his mobile phone but he could not even dream of texting or something like that
[  816.28-  818.96] MEO015: do you want to save it less than
[  819.96-  820.26] MEE014: yeah
[  821.36-  827.96] FEE016: yeah yeah can he program his remote control or is he basic with that too
[  826.06-  826.36] MEO015: oh
[  828.12-  831.44] FEE013: i do not think they tape things i do not think they have things
[  829.36-  834.04] MEE014: yeah my granddad is actually better than me at using teletext so
[  830.04-  830.60] FEE016: right
[  833.26-  833.80] FEE016: right
[  834.64-  840.00] FEE016: so that is the problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with that is going to be a problem
[  838.64-  839.00] MEE014: yeah
[  840.00-  844.64] FEE016: well anyway with the older generation perhaps and that is another ethia we tackle that
[  841.20-  843.24] FEE013: yeah yeah
[  843.72-  849.58] MEE014: yeah well it just needs to be as long as it is sort of self intuitive and you can can work out
[  850.98-  861.94] MEE014: what everything is doing cause i mean menus on sort of new phones now they have sort of got all these sort of pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you are trying to do
[  864.30-  870.00] FEE013: i do not know i d i do not like the you know the new phones that are kind of got a windows based
[  864.44-  865.76] MEE014: i do not know how
[  870.00-  871.74] FEE013: running system
[  870.18-  870.68] MEE014: oh yeah
[  872.96-  883.24] FEE013: i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the phone i d i had not got a new one but my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost but
[  878.36-  878.80] FEE016: right
[  884.38-  885.16] FEE013: that is just me
[  885.18-  899.32] MEE014: yeah i do not i do not know how for twenty five or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get you would you would have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l c d thing anyway just
[  893.64-  894.32] FEE013: yeah
[  898.72-  900.00] FEE016: is it possible that that
[  900.00-  911.78] FEE016: for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books obviously it displays less on the screen it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that is the main thing
[  905.32-  905.70] MEO015: ok
[  905.76-  907.50] FEE013: cause it has got that option as well
[  911.86-  912.36] FEE013: yeah
[  913.68-  930.00] FEE013: or what about kind of a dual function in that you have got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures obvious
[  930.00-  934.88] FEE013: symbols and that is where you control recording and things like that
[  930.84-  931.44] FEE016: right
[  934.74-  947.56] FEE016: the other thing is just ta tucking into mobile phone design features again we could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over
[  946.04-  946.66] MEO015: ok
[  948.48-  953.06] FEE013: i think that is a cost thing i do not i do not know how much we are going to know about
[  948.60-  949.08] MEO015: i
[  949.90-  950.20] MEE014: i do not
[  950.92-  959.24] MEO015: it might it might save a p bit of space instead of looking bulky it might look small but it might have its cost implications
[  951.06-  951.40] FEE016: yeah
[  956.02-  958.08] FEE013: yes no that is important
[  956.78-  958.60] FEE016: yeah that is important
[  957.24-  957.60] MEE014: yeah
[  959.48-  960.00] FEE013: right and there is
[  960.00-  972.44] FEE016: no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be lightweight plastic you know something that is easily molded and reduced sorry i am treading on your territory guys
[  966.22-  966.48] MEO015: right
[  968.84-  969.24] FEE013: yeah
[  970.68-  971.68] MEE014: no you are not
[  972.92-  979.94] FEE013: right ok we have got half an hour before the next meeting so we are all going to go off and do our individual things
[  981.20-  989.52] FEE013: i think that is probably about it and then we will come back and liase again and i get to do another fantastic part point presentation
[  985.48-  990.00] MEE014: yeah just just
[  990.00- 1014.64] MEE014: a quick thing about the about what you were saying about the does not does not need to be fashionable the sort of i i had a quick look at the company website and it is like the the we put the fashion into electronics so i think i think the whole design thing might be quite i mean you do not you you can still have plastic and it look quite good but
[  991.08-  991.48] FEE013: sure
[ 1005.06- 1005.74] FEE016: right
[ 1005.78- 1006.26] MEO015: ok
[ 1005.86- 1006.44] FEE013: ok
[ 1006.90- 1007.50] FEE016: ok
[ 1009.16- 1011.30] FEE016: sure yeah
[ 1013.70- 1020.00] FEE016: but yeah i mean it does not have to be that you know but that was my main point we do not have to use metal i do not know if
[ 1018.54- 1018.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 1020.00- 1024.40] FEE016: using plastic does not make it cheaper i have seen it would yeah
[ 1022.00- 1022.96] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1022.32- 1024.00] FEE013: it would yeah probably
[ 1025.04- 1041.56] FEE013: i mean the sky remote controls and everything they are kind of molded and look a bit different and the telly west remote controls are silver plastic which looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that is tougher to think about ok so let us break it up there
[ 1032.92- 1033.36] FEE016: yeah
[ 1037.32- 1037.96] FEE016: kay
[ 1042.20- 1042.32] FEE016: kay
[ 1042.40- 1044.16] FEE013: ok so see you in half an hour
[ 1042.58- 1043.44] MEE014: ok
[ 1046.42- 1048.48] FEE016: do we go back to our room
[ 1047.76- 1049.04] FEE013: think so yeah
[ 1048.04- 1048.38] MEO015: ok

[   27.04-   27.80] FEE016: not really sure
[   27.04-   27.80] MEE014: not really sure
[   27.04-   27.80] MEO015: not really sure
[   33.48-   36.24] MEE014: you should not have to do the option f a you again it should just appear in
[   33.48-   36.24] MEO015: you should not have to do the option f a you again it should just appear in
[   37.04-   39.72] FEE013: oh right ok actually we will work so
[   48.36-   49.28] FEE016: oh
[   55.44-   55.86] FEE013: ok
[   66.80-   78.86] FEE013: right ok this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second
[   80.30-   81.52] FEE016: no that is ok it is ok
[   81.26-   83.40] FEE013: ok
[   85.92-   88.70] FEE013: i will go over what we decided last meeting
[   92.64-   99.12] FEE013: we decided upon a universal control one handset for all t v video
[  100.62-  120.00] FEE013: equipment that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of the consumers wide age range not limiting anyone we decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product we put fashion in electronics you know that kind of thing
[  100.70-  100.94] MEO015: yeah
[  120.00-  129.48] FEE013: our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget that we might
[  131.42-  144.14] FEE013: have a bit of oh oh you can see it ok dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like
[  144.84-  150.00] FEE013: want it to look uncluttered undaunting to the customer we discussed a flip open
[  150.00-  159.36] FEE013: design reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming things like that
[  161.20-  166.80] FEE013: kay three presentations i have got written here so
[  168.66-  170.62] FEE013: shall we hear from marketing first
[  171.00-  175.84] FEE016: is it ok if i postpone that till later i just want to get access to a little bit more information is that ok
[  175.02-  177.32] FEE013: no that is fine that is fine
[  176.50-  179.24] MEE014: ok yeah i will go first nice crowd thing
[  179.08-  179.82] FEE013: ok ok
[  182.12-  183.42] MEE014: that is
[  191.56-  193.32] MEE014: you can i just press old f n
[  194.00-  195.12] FEE013: f n
[  195.96-  197.26] FEE013: function f n
[  196.84-  197.90] MEE014: oh my god
[  200.96-  201.44] MEE014: bet red
[  203.68-  204.56] MEE014: what do you do
[  209.34-  209.78] MEO015: yeah
[  210.00-  210.62] MEE014: there we go
[  212.50-  218.48] MEE014: ok this is the working design presented by me the industrial design extra there
[  219.96-  240.00] MEE014: ok this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design well a device which basically just sends the signal to the t v to change the state whether that be the power or the channel or the volume everything is just
[  240.00-  246.92] MEE014: some sort of signal to change the state of the t v or other appliances sending the signal to
[  249.02-  260.06] MEE014: so i decided i would have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that but although we will want to be taking
[  261.48-  270.00] MEE014: ideas from other people we want to make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was not really my
[  270.00-  271.80] MEE014: area because
[  272.66-  300.00] MEE014: i am dealing with the inside really so i yeah i ran out of time so i can not do this one as fun as the last one and i found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t v presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that can be use wireless and you do not need to send very much information most of them are
[  300.00-  322.22] MEE014: powered by some form of battery now r one i am i am not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control yeah sure
[  319.14-  326.76] FEE016: can i interject to ask a question is that appropriate you are saying the triple a batteries are small d or the camera can be shown
[  321.50-  321.96] FEE013: yeah
[  325.58-  329.96] MEE014: no no if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they are quite they are quite
[  330.00-  360.00] MEE014: chunky and that is because of the size of the batteries they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in yeah the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i am just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across and which leads sort of on to the next point about them being small and easy to carry around now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit
[  335.96-  338.76] FEE016: but triple o they are the smallest you can get there
[  338.28-  338.72] FEE013: yeah
[  338.56-  338.76] MEO015: yeah
[  341.56-  342.56] FEE016: oh i see
[  345.52-  345.90] FEE016: ok
[  360.00-  360.32] MEE014: more
[  361.64-  390.00] MEE014: now the main components i came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries cause otherwise it is not going to work as i said about the m which batteries we were going to choose we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you are putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i infrared signal which we are going to
[  390.00-  417.86] MEE014: use to send the information now these have a wireless range of up to about five meters which is sort of suitable for anyone who is watching their t v unless they are in a cinema which not most people do so as we are applying to the most audience that should be fine and then i was just had a quick look at the external design but i i left that mostly to the interface designer
[  419.18-  420.00] MEE014: and so this is
[  420.00-  441.80] MEE014: what i had as the basic idea of what we want to do it is not a proper circuit i am not sure if it will work or not i am not even confident that those the real the real way you would wire it up but anyway we have just got the the power going to the infrared bulb the chip and the u i interface
[  443.36-  450.00] MEE014: which would basically when you when you have pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i
[  450.00-  458.80] MEE014: data which could be decoded by the t v receiver which obviously means that we are going to have to conform to whatever
[  459.92-  480.00] MEE014: whatever form of communication that the t v s are already using and since that that is another usin reason to use infrared because that is what all t v s use at the moment and then finally we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost
[  480.00-  510.00] MEE014: so all the components that i have put forward are low in cost so that that should be good it should should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base as we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about because they are small they are also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of i dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa
[  510.00-  519.02] MEE014: thing that you could have i th that was just sort of a general point there and that is yeah
[  515.94-  523.58] FEE016: that is a very important point it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that when i would like me to present
[  521.70-  528.60] MEE014: alright ok and yeah that is that is what i came up with there so
[  527.68-  532.36] FEE013: ok thank you very much would you like to continue on from there
[  531.36-  531.92] MEO015: yep
[  535.76-  539.00] MEO015: so maybe make that telephone if you want me
[  535.92-  538.56] FEE013: or maybe with that top of the board
[  545.08-  545.50] MEO015: tie for them
[  572.80-  572.98] MEO015: yes
[  591.04-  593.80] MEO015: i think that will be a field right
[  594.76-  596.32] FEE013: f
[  595.48-  596.80] MEE014: function event yes
[  596.60-  597.14] MEO015: ok
[  602.56-  604.16] MEO015: as it not right
[  602.62-  602.92] FEE016: no
[  604.86-  607.60] FEE016: the plug has not come out at the
[  606.72-  608.14] MEO015: yeah it is
[  607.44-  610.98] MEE014: yeah
[  609.04-  610.00] FEE016: i do
[  612.74-  613.56] FEE013: oh there
[  613.26-  613.68] MEO015: ok
[  614.76-  630.00] MEO015: yeah actually m some of my points might overlap with what william is just mentioned but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some
[  618.68-  619.08] MEE014: yeah
[  630.00-  635.48] MEO015: missing loops in this thing which i think will take a feedback from the marketing because
[  636.92-  652.98] MEO015: i have not had some marketing data and basically every product is market driven so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t v to make make it as simple as possible and to summarize i i would say it is it should be user friendly by being easy to use
[  654.04-  660.00] MEO015: rather than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering driven maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having
[  660.00-  661.92] MEO015: a a remote control which has the main features
[  663.14-  666.22] MEO015: like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever
[  667.40-  690.00] MEO015: but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy we will punch in these two features together so what the concept is to have a flip top model the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to pro say program their favorite channels or whatever
[  690.00-  706.54] MEO015: a can be put in the middle part of the fl flip top so it is like it could be accessed by a wider range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to lot of people
[  708.26-  720.00] MEO015: findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they have they have not used maybe thirty p to forty percent of
[  720.00-  743.78] MEO015: buttons so it is no of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of of a higher production like fifty million we said yeah with that i think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly
[  736.04-  736.36] MEE014: yeah
[  747.62-  750.00] MEO015: that is so this is if you ask me personally
[  750.00-  752.12] MEO015: personally i would make a
[  754.48-  769.04] MEO015: flip top with a trendy design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whether whether they are like soft or a little hard because there are times the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous u usage and all that so in overall a simple and a
[  762.28-  762.86] MEE014: yes
[  770.84-  771.76] MEO015: user friendly design
[  772.44-  773.00] FEE016: right
[  773.02-  774.68] MEO015: any comment if you want
[  773.24-  773.66] FEE013: ok
[  775.52-  780.00] FEE013: i think we will chat about it at the end ok so if
[  778.40-  779.36] MEO015: ok
[  780.00-  784.32] FEE013: anyone wants to write something down they want to be in there at the end
[  782.80-  783.20] FEE016: yeah
[  782.92-  783.70] MEE014: yeah
[  788.56-  790.92] FEE013: oh i am going to get it all right
[  792.60-  793.40] FEE013: oh god
[  802.68-  803.36] FEE013: ok
[  803.08-  806.52] FEE016: have i got to keep this here
[  803.44-  804.48] MEO015: i
[  805.44-  806.20] MEO015: you can not
[  807.26-  809.50] MEO015: you will have to this can not be put
[  808.76-  810.00] FEE016: i have to have to really
[  810.00-  811.04] FEE013: the best of them
[  810.00-  820.68] FEE016: whoops ok i am finished a bit more
[  813.00-  814.24] MEO015: you are going to push it a bit more
[  817.96-  818.22] MEO015: yep
[  819.28-  820.28] MEO015: that is more than enough
[  826.60-  828.32] MEE014: ok got a bit more
[  827.04-  827.84] MEO015: oh yeah
[  828.10-  828.82] FEE016: oh
[  830.72-  830.98] MEE014: ok
[  831.36-  832.36] FEE016: is that ok
[  834.36-  835.50] MEO015: yeah then we can pull it out now
[  836.80-  839.96] FEE016: thank you let us pull it closer a little bit
[  840.08-  843.98] MEE014: we should be able to do that in a way i think we are able to do that in a way
[  841.30-  841.98] FEE013: yeah
[  841.70-  843.88] FEE016: right over thank you
[  843.76-  843.92] FEE013: yeah
[  844.90-  845.44] FEE013: ok
[  845.64-  870.00] FEE016: ok so i am going to look at the functional requirements from a marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research so that is where we started we used our our usability lab the company is usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public male and female all age groups from fifteen upwards and
[  870.00-  876.26] FEE016: we observed them in the lab just their general use of the remote control you can see we had a hundred subjects there
[  877.28-  895.60] FEE016: our findings lots of findings i have just summarized some of them here the overall thing which i have i have got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls that has obvious design implications there we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
[  896.96-  900.00] FEE016: eighty percent would spend more money when a remote
[  900.00-  927.84] FEE016: would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding but that is quite a high proportion of our our you know international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that is bit nicer looking current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall for example you can see below there seventy five percent of users zap a lot so you have got your person sunk back in the sofa channel bopping so again there is power implications there
[  922.60-  922.74] MEO015: yeah
[  930.00-  943.04] FEE016: users only used ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do not have so many functions actually on the remote control
[  946.90-  960.00] FEE016: the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you you mentioned earlier remote controls are often lost in the room as a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing fifty percent were
[  960.00-  975.20] FEE016: were particularly frustrated by that thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons they just can not be bothered to learn about the other functions
[  976.08-  990.00] FEE016: slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems the vast
[  990.00- 1020.00] FEE016: of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition again that was to aid i think in when they have lost the actual remote control some kind of speech recognition something we did not put to them but which i am thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until we find it or a flashing light possibly that trend reverses in the older age groups so thirty fives and unders who would like those two
[ 1020.00- 1026.46] FEE016: features that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses they are not so bothered with this
[ 1027.48- 1036.14] FEE016: i had marvelous tables and things that i could show you but i think i will just keep it simple if there is any more information i can email you with extra details is that ok
[ 1027.78- 1027.96] MEO015: f
[ 1034.60- 1036.30] FEE013: ok ok
[ 1035.24- 1035.74] MEE014: ok
[ 1036.16- 1036.52] MEO015: that is fine
[ 1038.68- 1040.58] FEE013: right
[ 1039.00- 1039.28] MEE014: y
[ 1041.72- 1044.86] FEE013: we have new project requirements
[ 1051.10- 1061.40] FEE013: we are not going to be using teletext apparently the consumer is considered outdated with the internet now
[ 1054.20- 1054.56] MEO015: ok
[ 1062.40- 1078.44] FEE013: our control is only going to be for t v it is not going to be a combined control which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer
[ 1076.84- 1080.00] FEE016: right so can we not program a video with this remote control
[ 1080.00- 1080.58] FEE016: so
[ 1080.56- 1091.80] FEE013: says for t v only so looks like it is just yeah i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
[ 1084.48- 1085.36] FEE016: just channels yeah
[ 1094.24- 1102.12] FEE013: i do not know what do you think it just said for t v only i mean general t v controls do do video as well
[ 1097.68- 1099.30] FEE016: would that apply video
[ 1099.28- 1101.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 1103.64- 1105.86] MEE014: i do well i do know cause the if you
[ 1104.44- 1108.88] FEE013: i mean you well well so you get con you get combined t v and videos do not you
[ 1108.34- 1110.00] MEE014: yeah if yeah and if you have got
[ 1108.66- 1110.00] FEE016: yes
[ 1110.00- 1122.32] MEE014: if you have got a sky box one of those sky plus boxes now you can record straight off the t v anywhere say onto onto like the t v hard drive or something
[ 1122.44- 1127.00] FEE013: i think we assume it has still got play and stop functions and the programming
[ 1125.84- 1126.50] FEE016: yes
[ 1127.26- 1127.68] MEE014: yeah
[ 1127.46- 1133.88] MEO015: anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether the people want a combined something like that
[ 1134.28- 1140.00] FEE016: we did not really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use
[ 1140.00- 1156.68] FEE016: about ten percent of the buttons i think that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video fast forwarding so on and i think it is of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos and i am so i do not know if that is something we need to
[ 1140.58- 1140.90] FEE013: yeah
[ 1140.90- 1141.28] MEO015: ok
[ 1146.24- 1146.52] MEE014: yeah
[ 1154.28- 1154.66] MEO015: ok
[ 1154.46- 1155.08] FEE013: yeah
[ 1155.84- 1166.32] MEE014: j just as an idea on the speech recognition thing they would pro it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they are not there great anyway
[ 1162.44- 1162.70] MEO015: yeah
[ 1165.82- 1170.00] FEE016: right i have just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table relates
[ 1167.64- 1168.44] MEE014: right
[ 1170.00- 1189.00] FEE016: to both questions so we did not differentiate would you prefer an l c d screen that is a multifunction remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group i think that is just general fear of new technology
[ 1176.60- 1177.64] MEE014: oh right ok
[ 1182.76- 1183.08] MEE014: yeah
[ 1188.44- 1190.20] FEE013: yeah
[ 1188.64- 1200.00] MEE014: yeah but on on that again i just thought cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it will let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i felt that
[ 1196.30- 1197.04] FEE016: yeah
[ 1199.16- 1200.00] FEE016: right
[ 1200.00- 1200.68] MEE014: could be for
[ 1200.74- 1217.84] FEE013: we do have a budget limitation that we can not control ourselves so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you
[ 1218.64- 1230.00] FEE013: use to find it needs to be something that you do not lose so you were saying whistling maybe o on the t v you could put like a pack on the t v or something so you can not see the remote you go and press the button on
[ 1222.04- 1223.40] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1230.00- 1237.12] FEE013: top of the t v and it beeps and you are ok it is over there something like that but that is that sounds a lot cheaper to me
[ 1232.06- 1232.56] FEE016: yeah
[ 1232.14- 1232.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 1232.40- 1232.88] MEO015: ok
[ 1233.66- 1234.68] FEE016: that is a different idea
[ 1234.92- 1237.16] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1238.00- 1252.52] FEE013: the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset so we want logo we want
[ 1254.90- 1258.56] FEE013: fashionable trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing
[ 1260.00- 1263.72] FEE013: people paying more for it to look good
[ 1264.92- 1267.80] FEE013: we need to focus on that as well
[ 1267.34- 1290.00] FEE016: well further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is it is going to be different for a fifteen year old for somebody who is sixty and also across the world if we are aiming at the international market what is attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i dunno if you get the idea it is it is going to vary around the world at the end of the day the the end
[ 1273.88- 1274.46] FEE013: yeah
[ 1290.00- 1299.68] FEE016: engineering design is one thing it is the user interface design that may and that the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets around the world
[ 1294.12- 1295.02] MEE014: yeah
[ 1299.76- 1300.24] FEE013: yeah
[ 1300.20- 1305.40] MEO015: so are we talking of a single model or maybe five six designs in our
[ 1306.28- 1306.56] MEO015: sure
[ 1306.30- 1312.04] MEE014: well i think y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they would be essentially exactly the same
[ 1308.80- 1309.00] MEO015: oh
[ 1311.92- 1312.16] MEO015: right
[ 1313.28- 1317.16] MEE014: just yeah yeah
[ 1313.48- 1316.64] MEO015: the features could be same and the body could look slightly different
[ 1313.86- 1314.20] FEE016: yeah
[ 1318.08- 1318.60] MEO015: so
[ 1320.38- 1334.68] FEE013: what about you were talking about the buttons the controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons not tiny little one big rubber buttons but what about i mean cause we got to make it original
[ 1323.04- 1323.26] MEO015: yeah
[ 1335.28- 1335.94] MEE014: kay
[ 1336.20- 1337.36] FEE013: what about
[ 1338.68- 1342.02] FEE013: you know with the touch screen computers
[ 1340.68- 1344.62] MEE014: yeah yeah that is what was just yeah
[ 1343.34- 1350.00] FEE013: yeah so you it is like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which
[ 1350.00- 1353.92] FEE013: should not wear out as much either not sure about the
[ 1352.90- 1356.22] MEE014: no well no cause you would not have to you do not have to have to press on this
[ 1355.18- 1370.76] FEE013: you do not have to press it you just have to put your thumb on to it i think that might appeal i am thinking kind of japan i am thinking young office people trendy kind of thing
[ 1357.48- 1357.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 1366.52- 1368.18] FEE016: oh
[ 1369.74- 1370.16] MEE014: yeah
[ 1370.00- 1372.52] FEE016: yeah is it well the pull to sections of them are in the
[ 1372.06- 1380.00] FEE013: but quite easily labeled so that anyone can do oh yeah that is obvious what
[ 1380.00- 1385.60] FEE013: that is for and it is not daunting to maybe the older generations
[ 1383.36- 1384.96] FEE016: generations
[ 1384.10- 1405.72] MEE014: but also er ergonomics as we are saying of the different designs ergonomics there is sort of physically different things cause if you have ever seen the x box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would not buy it because the control all was physically too big because
[ 1402.84- 1403.56] FEE013: were too big
[ 1406.92- 1410.00] MEE014: their cut just generally japanese people have
[ 1410.00- 1423.76] MEE014: smaller hands so they can go around the controller which is so if you i do not know what cause you obviously you could have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others
[ 1424.36- 1434.28] MEO015: yeah or maybe to as it it was indicated the risk for repeated use the injuries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that
[ 1433.94- 1435.72] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1436.72- 1440.00] MEO015: so a bigger b ok so you you are dividing designs
[ 1440.00- 1452.86] MEO015: there is not least segment age groups you are desi are dividing it according to the countries also the market maybe for u s and on you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan you need to have a small yeah
[ 1445.72- 1446.04] FEE016: ok
[ 1449.04- 1449.48] MEE014: yeah
[ 1452.20- 1452.96] MEE014: yeah
[ 1452.56- 1465.40] FEE013: i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to th in the sense that they can make it smaller or they can make it bigger or they can change features slightly
[ 1456.00- 1456.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 1461.70- 1462.16] MEE014: yeah
[ 1463.76- 1464.14] FEE016: yeah
[ 1465.28- 1469.52] FEE016: the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same
[ 1467.96- 1470.00] FEE013: it is going to be the same so we need to focus
[ 1470.00- 1477.16] FEE013: on just one thing and not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities
[ 1471.32- 1471.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 1471.32- 1471.68] MEE014: yeah
[ 1477.56- 1494.84] FEE016: i am concerned when you raise the the r s i issue again repetitive strain injury i do not think just moving your finger round on a small screen is going to deal with that enough i think that is still a kind of question mark issue how we deal with that r s i tends to be caused by repetitive small movements
[ 1491.38- 1492.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 1496.08- 1500.00] FEE016: i am d i really can not get my head round this one this may have to be postponed to a future meeting
[ 1498.24- 1498.64] MEE014: yeah
[ 1500.00- 1501.80] FEE016: but it is something you should think about
[ 1501.92- 1513.04] MEE014: i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel it becomes yeah
[ 1510.52- 1513.22] FEE016: i know and it becomes ridiculous yeah yeah
[ 1512.86- 1519.74] FEE013: or a speech recognition which is th extremely expensive i think that is the only way that you can avoid
[ 1514.24- 1517.24] MEE014: yeah speech recognition but yeah
[ 1514.44- 1514.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 1517.26- 1517.82] FEE016: yeah
[ 1520.84- 1521.76] FEE013: that kind of issue
[ 1522.08- 1528.76] FEE016: do we have to initially you know looking at the findings here focus on
[ 1530.20- 1538.04] FEE016: younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later do we really have to go for everyone right away
[ 1537.50- 1539.40] MEO015: we could focus on the biggest market
[ 1540.24- 1541.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 1540.40- 1543.64] MEO015: so if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market
[ 1542.64- 1547.88] FEE016: now when we are drawing up our ideas we are automatically talking about business people young people trendy people
[ 1547.52- 1550.02] FEE013: we are we are talking about
[ 1552.04- 1560.00] FEE013: the type of company that we are working for as well that they want it to be fashionable they want it to be trendy and you would not
[ 1560.00- 1579.84] FEE013: automatically assume associate that with the older generations now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a greater population than us young people but i do not think we are focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of mid range
[ 1571.96- 1572.36] MEE014: yeah
[ 1572.74- 1573.04] MEO015: yeah
[ 1581.24- 1583.60] FEE013: business kind of class type people
[ 1582.60- 1590.00] FEE016: but i am just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage we want to you know not
[ 1590.00- 1593.36] FEE016: waste money not be profligate and
[ 1595.38- 1602.76] FEE016: you know focus on where the idea will be taken up first it is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this
[ 1604.72- 1616.12] FEE013: ok so the remote control functions we have got the t v we have got the video now there is
[ 1617.50- 1620.00] FEE013: i can not remember what it is called the little code at the end
[ 1620.00- 1623.92] FEE013: of program details yes
[ 1622.40- 1623.52] MEE014: video plus yeah
[ 1625.80- 1637.56] FEE013: we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it
[ 1631.98- 1633.16] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1635.40- 1635.60] FEE016: yeah
[ 1638.84- 1650.00] FEE013: because you have got your general record anyway so if you there is a program on you want to put record on that is fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you are not sure if you are going to you would
[ 1647.80- 1649.12] MEE014: just fine yeah
[ 1650.00- 1658.76] FEE013: put the number in and it is just a number it is not a date it is not time it is not a channel it is not when it finishes it is not anything like that it is just a number
[ 1656.88- 1665.56] MEE014: and you would yeah and you would not you would not need a a whole host of extra buttons for that you would just need well cause you have already got them now so yeah
[ 1662.48- 1662.86] FEE013: yeah
[ 1664.24- 1666.40] FEE013: you have already got the numbers for typing in anyway
[ 1665.68- 1670.40] FEE016: i have not come across that function but it sounds wonderful
[ 1669.40- 1680.00] FEE013: it is after if you look in the newspaper or t v guide or any t v guide there is a five six digit number afterwards and that is the number you put in and it is a number of times that you have to be able to do it in the number of times that you have have have have
[ 1671.84- 1672.44] MEE014: sort
[ 1675.92- 1676.40] MEE014: yeah
[ 1680.00- 1694.56] FEE013: it is recorded that it is going to be on on tuesdays at ten o clock on the seventeenths things like that so you do not have to worry about dates and you do not have to worry about times and it has been around for quite a long time
[ 1690.16- 1690.56] FEE016: ok
[ 1693.48- 1699.12] MEE014: it has been been around for a long time it is just it is not very well advertised and it is hard to use it and
[ 1697.12- 1702.64] FEE013: no it is not but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
[ 1702.08- 1710.00] MEE014: yeah though if you if you have got something like sky anywhere you can just click on it you can just press the button on the program one
[ 1702.48- 1703.16] FEE016: yes
[ 1710.00- 1714.56] MEE014: and it will record that program when it is on and you press it on it twice and it will record the whole series
[ 1711.50- 1712.20] FEE016: right
[ 1714.60- 1716.36] FEE016: excellent
[ 1716.08- 1722.04] MEE014: so that yeah but just to have that s function would be would be really good
[ 1720.74- 1721.28] FEE016: right
[ 1722.28- 1722.94] FEE013: ok so
[ 1723.20- 1740.00] FEE016: can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i do not mean to quickly jump from one subject to another but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups that occurs to me we all were to produce our own mobile phones that that is kind of what led us on to comparing t v remote controls with with their design features and
[ 1740.00- 1769.14] FEE016: chain companies like carphone warehouse you can pop in any time with a phone that you have bought for them if you have got any problems with it and they will fix it they will phone the company you can use their telephones is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets that you know which button is that i press for this that is a free that is a free aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to them
[ 1747.48- 1747.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 1770.00- 1794.40] MEE014: but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you sign for a contract so they the companies who who you deal with have actually they have they have got an obligation to to help you out and also i mean it is it is fair enough to have some sort of help service but i i am not sure how much the cost would be of having
[ 1793.80- 1794.40] FEE016: right
[ 1794.44- 1800.00] FEE013: the functionality of it in the sense that you are sitting there you are pressing this button and your t v is not doing it
[ 1800.00- 1800.40] FEE013: it
[ 1800.72- 1801.16] FEE016: alright
[ 1801.24- 1805.92] FEE013: taking your t v and your control and saying look this is what i am doing it is not working what should i do
[ 1802.52- 1803.54] FEE016: oh yes
[ 1806.08- 1816.22] FEE016: if it was something as simple as you could not change a channel but i mean for if there were any more or were we absolutely definite it is only going to be for t v and video i think so ok it is just a thought
[ 1813.44- 1814.08] MEE014: yeah i mean
[ 1813.66- 1816.02] FEE013: i think so
[ 1816.40- 1820.14] MEE014: i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon it can be
[ 1818.28- 1830.00] FEE013: instruction manual but i mean there there is customer service there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there is
[ 1819.52- 1820.00] FEE016: ok
[ 1823.18- 1823.96] MEE014: yeah
[ 1825.40- 1826.48] MEE014: department yeah
[ 1828.40- 1829.00] FEE016: sure
[ 1830.00- 1836.34] FEE013: no call out charge there is no extra the person has to walk to a shop on the high street
[ 1833.96- 1843.28] MEO015: i i think it will make too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and i will not
[ 1834.88- 1835.16] FEE016: yeah
[ 1839.56- 1840.04] MEE014: yeah
[ 1841.90- 1845.50] FEE016: not pretty simple functions because we are focusing on that yeah
[ 1842.28- 1845.10] MEE014: the yeah but it should be yeah
[ 1844.08- 1860.00] FEE013: but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing in lots and lots of pages it does you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it so that should be something with the
[ 1847.52- 1847.88] MEO015: simple
[ 1848.60- 1849.14] FEE016: yeah
[ 1848.94- 1849.20] MEE014: yeah
[ 1850.92- 1851.68] MEE014: yeah
[ 1853.34- 1855.86] FEE016: fits people not reading them do they do they know the idea
[ 1854.04- 1854.88] MEE014: it does
[ 1858.40- 1860.00] FEE016: true
[ 1860.00- 1879.22] FEE013: about what other functions we need i am not sure if we need a design decision now but we should think about ca cause you have got the dilemma between oh batteries that is what i was thinking about what about phone batteries what kind of battery is that
[ 1860.00- 1860.28] FEE016: ok
[ 1879.56- 1889.70] MEE014: they are they are specially made for the for the mobile phones but they come with a charger i mean you could you could bundle a charger
[ 1888.54- 1890.00] FEE013: well they la they they la
[ 1890.00- 1910.04] FEE013: last quite a long time and if you had when you the thing that you get with mobile house phones you sit it in its charger when you are not using it or at night or something but it does not really matter cause it never really runs out cause it lasts a long time once it is charged something like that should reduce the size of it
[ 1897.24- 1897.88] MEE014: yeah
[ 1900.46- 1900.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 1900.72- 1901.40] MEO015: yeah
[ 1904.96- 1905.32] MEE014: yeah
[ 1909.08- 1917.28] MEE014: yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the blooper in the remote could
[ 1918.20- 1920.00] FEE013: yeah it could be on that yeah
[ 1919.28- 1920.00] MEE014: yeah on that
[ 1920.00- 1921.08] FEE013: ok
[ 1920.00- 1920.56] MEE014: as well so
[ 1922.50- 1922.82] FEE013: s
[ 1922.52- 1926.16] MEO015: so are we talking of the concept of rechargeable something or something
[ 1925.52- 1929.70] MEE014: yeah some sort of docking station or yeah
[ 1926.10- 1926.66] FEE013: yes
[ 1927.72- 1929.46] FEE013: rechargeable with a docking station
[ 1930.74- 1932.60] FEE013: so the rechargeable would be your
[ 1933.38- 1939.64] MEE014: yeah yeah that yeah that that would be fine and also that would mean they would not have to go out buying batteries all the time
[ 1934.02- 1934.38] FEE013: fiel
[ 1936.12- 1936.68] FEE013: ok
[ 1939.52- 1950.00] FEE013: yes which is cheaper in the last one as well the c the shape you have got trendy i do not want a big box with lots of
[ 1941.38- 1941.76] MEE014: yeah
[ 1950.00- 1962.44] FEE013: things you do not want a tiny sort of little thing either because then you have got the repetitive strain engine no matter how many y how much you try and make it simple
[ 1962.60- 1977.64] FEE016: and we do not want i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical these long brown things with the same colored buttons all crowned in on the s the surface we definitely an o an obvious thing a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles we do not want that
[ 1966.08- 1966.76] FEE013: they do
[ 1966.24- 1966.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 1977.18- 1978.76] FEE013: ok so we have got a flip screen
[ 1977.88- 1978.00] MEO015: yeah
[ 1982.82- 2005.88] MEO015: what i was thinking of a design which nokia came up with almost six or seven years back basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box like a chocolate that is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they come up with something like this curved up so here and you do not have to you do not bend your thumb too much so it is like a you can say a banana shape kind of thing curved up like a boat
[ 1991.52- 1992.52] MEE014: yeah
[ 2003.78- 2005.52] FEE016: like card
[ 2005.14- 2005.82] MEE014: yeah
[ 2006.00- 2006.52] FEE013: ok
[ 2007.44- 2010.00] MEO015: c so what happens is you do not have to
[ 2010.00- 2011.68] MEO015: press your thumb two down like
[ 2012.48- 2018.80] MEO015: so it is already curved up so your thumb does not yeah so we can have a s like you know mold it according to your
[ 2013.16- 2013.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 2013.80- 2015.64] FEE013: cause it is kind of rolled into your hand anyway
[ 2019.84- 2020.12] MEE014: yeah
[ 2019.96- 2023.60] MEO015: the way you hold off it is kind of semi circle in the bottom something like that
[ 2024.00- 2024.52] FEE013: ok
[ 2024.82- 2027.46] MEO015: i will not say exactly semi circle but yeah
[ 2026.40- 2030.26] FEE013: can you look into the company logo
[ 2031.50- 2040.00] FEE013: things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product
[ 2040.00- 2041.30] FEE013: i mean
[ 2040.44- 2041.24] MEO015: probably
[ 2043.22- 2058.76] FEE013: for example if it was a c or something like that you could have it in a vague c shape that opens up kind of like a shell or something something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
[ 2060.40- 2066.44] FEE013: obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that is there
[ 2067.28- 2068.32] MEO015: we could look at that like
[ 2067.80- 2069.24] FEE016: that would be true
[ 2070.00- 2072.74] MEO015: what we were talking is to make it
[ 2074.10- 2083.68] MEO015: rather than like sea shells logo could become means you could put a logo in the corner of a model rather than you know trying to make it like a sea shell or what you are ta telling me
[ 2083.40- 2086.00] FEE013: well we need to think about how it is going to look different
[ 2087.04- 2100.00] FEE016: i think that is that sounds a really attractive idea i have not come across anything like that before if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip top then it is nice to you can make it lightweight plastic nice to hold in the palm of the hand
[ 2090.24- 2090.98] MEO015: a sea shell
[ 2095.60- 2096.08] MEE014: yeah
[ 2100.00- 2121.20] FEE016: and just because you are having to actually insert in between the two covers that is going to take care of some of the repetitive strain injury try and prevent a lot of it i would think i think it is a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we are using plastic you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic you can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior
[ 2110.56- 2111.72] MEO015: yeah we could look on it back
[ 2121.64- 2130.00] FEE013: or you could do different like you get with mobile phones different fascias you could have different kind of
[ 2127.80- 2128.24] FEE016: you could have
[ 2130.00- 2138.40] FEE013: casings so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
[ 2130.72- 2131.08] FEE016: yeah
[ 2133.20- 2133.58] FEE016: yeah
[ 2138.30- 2155.52] FEE016: less chance of it being lost too it is not like a chocolate brown lozenge that is going to go down the surface people might want to put it on their mantle piece or whatever as a ca if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they do not they are not going to lose it so much that is it is easiest to put nice to handle
[ 2142.98- 2143.58] FEE013: yeah
[ 2154.56- 2160.00] MEO015: yeah maybe we could come with some say five six six designs and then choose which are which are will appease some much like
[ 2158.76- 2159.24] FEE013: ok
[ 2159.40- 2159.80] FEE016: yeah
[ 2159.40- 2159.80] MEE014: yeah
[ 2160.00- 2161.64] MEO015: like that could be the most common design
[ 2160.38- 2160.84] FEE013: ok
[ 2161.98- 2162.64] FEE016: ok
[ 2162.52- 2162.92] FEE013: ok
[ 2162.84- 2164.60] MEO015: if we can like think of five six reasons
[ 2164.98- 2167.48] FEE013: right i think we have to round it up
[ 2168.00- 2181.32] FEE016: can i just quickly go over the new project requirements so that i have not missed anything so it is no teletext it is only for t v owned by implication video corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control something about video plot
[ 2168.84- 2169.24] FEE013: sure
[ 2175.08- 2175.32] MEO015: yeah
[ 2182.36- 2190.00] FEE013: that was in cutting down the number that was kind of separate that was cutting down the number of functions
[ 2188.74- 2189.30] FEE016: right
[ 2190.00- 2195.84] FEE013: s making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
[ 2190.20- 2190.92] FEE016: right
[ 2194.12- 2200.88] FEE016: right so when they press the programming you it comes up on the l c d a reminder by using video plus so that they will look at the guide and
[ 2202.32- 2206.64] FEE016: or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that was an add on feature
[ 2206.96- 2215.88] FEE013: well it is kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that it could be
[ 2211.56- 2211.94] FEE016: right
[ 2213.46- 2218.08] FEE016: right so it is kind of doing away with the programming feature right
[ 2216.56- 2220.00] FEE013: i yes it could be an adverd advertisement
[ 2216.72- 2217.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 2220.00- 2226.02] FEE013: smant feature rather than design feature you know drawn attention to that
[ 2226.72- 2235.56] FEE013: and also paid lip service in the instruction manual cause it is very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
[ 2235.20- 2241.92] FEE016: and the rechargeable batteries was there anything else there that we project requirements
[ 2237.12- 2237.42] FEE013: yeah
[ 2240.02- 2240.40] FEE013: yeah
[ 2248.82- 2249.82] MEO015: yeah
[ 2250.00- 2256.76] FEE013: up the buttons but i think we will work through that with the design of it
[ 2252.76- 2253.06] MEO015: yeah
[ 2255.76- 2263.10] FEE016: that is not at the moment a requirement it is something we are looking at or preference so that we come round to market research at some point to sort it off
[ 2259.28- 2260.84] FEE013: yes yes
[ 2262.00- 2268.44] FEE013: and we have talked about there being an alarm or something a beeping or being lost
[ 2265.44- 2266.32] MEE014: yeah
[ 2265.44- 2267.72] MEO015: futty to shift right
[ 2270.04- 2280.00] FEE013: learning how to use it should be as simple as possible but there are not going to be that fun that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i would the instruction
[ 2280.00- 2283.84] FEE013: manual i do not know if we deal with that
[ 2285.96- 2286.44] FEE013: i think
[ 2289.84- 2294.14] FEE013: yeah and different from what is i do yeah i think that is us
[ 2290.30- 2291.40] MEO015: yeah
[ 2292.20- 2292.72] FEE016: ok
[ 2294.56- 2300.04] FEE016: what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting or shall i just sort of generally look at only as you know
[ 2294.80- 2295.02] MEO015: yeah
[ 2295.26- 2295.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 2300.12- 2303.76] FEE013: i think you might get guidance but
[ 2305.50- 2305.64] FEE013: i
[ 2307.16- 2309.76] FEE013: instruction manuals cause there tends to be a
[ 2308.52- 2308.84] FEE016: ok
[ 2311.60- 2318.52] FEE013: daemonized thing there everyone has got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them
[ 2318.56- 2319.14] FEE016: ok
[ 2322.72- 2324.24] FEE016: the question out for
[ 2323.04- 2324.12] MEO015: oops question out
[ 2324.14- 2325.96] FEE013: yes right ok
[ 2325.30- 2327.00] FEE016: could be a very nice time now i think
[ 2325.60- 2326.80] MEO015: nice sign out i think
[ 2329.28- 2329.82] MEO015: good point
[ 2330.86- 2331.50] FEE013: right ok
[ 2333.44- 2337.40] FEE013: i think you can email me if there is any more questions
[ 2340.00- 2341.96] FEE013: i know i will be able to not answer then

============================================================
SESSION: ES2004c
============================================================

[    0.00-    2.04] FEE013: i will wait until you are all room the next time
[   17.56-   19.14] FEE016: ok
[   22.84-   23.20] FEE016: ok
[   29.76-   30.00] FEE013: ok
[   30.00-   30.24] FEE013: kay
[   50.12-   50.56] FEE016: oh
[   52.40-   54.76] FEE013: that is going to be nice
[   54.22-   54.42] MEO015: yeah
[   78.08-   78.56] FEE013: ok
[   80.08-   83.88] FEE013: welcome back everybody hope you have had fun
[   82.48-   83.28] MEO015: yes
[   85.12-   85.36] MEO015: ok
[   85.44-   90.00] FEE013: right this is our conceptual design meeting
[   90.00-   93.52] FEE013: i think we are slightly ahead of ourselves
[   94.76-   99.68] FEE013: from the last meeting i th i i think yeah
[   96.00-   98.26] MEE014: yeah yeah i was getting in a question as well
[   98.28-   98.42] FEE016: yeah
[  101.04-  111.60] FEE013: this is where we talk about properties materials user interface and trend watching
[  109.84-  110.42] MEE014: sync
[  111.92-  112.28] FEE016: right
[  112.68-  115.00] FEE013: so i think we have touched on a few things
[  116.64-  118.92] FEE013: to that already but we will just go over it
[  122.98-  143.36] FEE013: the minutes from last time we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we could not use teletext it was not going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
[  144.72-  150.00] FEE013: we have decided on leaving out the voice
[  150.00-  165.40] FEE013: recognition we have decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what is normal we were thinking a shell but something along those lines it just a different shape from what is normal
[  168.96-  172.10] FEE013: you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
[  172.32-  172.64] MEE014: yeah
[  173.30-  180.00] FEE013: and we were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it lost things like that
[  177.68-  178.08] MEE014: yeah
[  180.00-  192.80] FEE013: and our market was going to be young business kind of range ok so shall we start with the first presentation yes if you feel
[  188.10-  188.36] MEO015: ok
[  191.24-  194.52] FEE016: shall i just connect up
[  191.78-  192.16] MEO015: yep
[  201.10-  201.44] FEE016: thank you
[  217.92-  228.52] FEE016: ok ok so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching
[  229.82-  232.40] FEE016: the methods we used to decide on
[  234.60-  240.00] FEE016: current trends and so on market trends were that we did our traditional our our usual market research study
[  240.00-  269.08] FEE016: with our hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most i am sorry i am slightly tongue tied after lunch sorry we decided on the most important aspect it required in a remote control device and we will come to that later so that was one of the first things we did also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion design in paris and milan
[  249.46-  250.60] FEE013: is
[  270.28-  289.56] FEE016: so the general findings from that was that in market trends the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative
[  290.90-  300.00] FEE016: and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important it is
[  300.00-  306.40] FEE016: twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
[  307.84-  330.00] FEE016: so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third it is still important but it is third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at ok now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion
[  316.02-  316.32] FEE013: yeah
[  330.00-  339.12] FEE016: hears then that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture so she could be thinking of using something like that in a remote control design too
[  340.12-  356.54] FEE016: there also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan it will be interesting to see what our design people make of that
[  356.94-  357.16] MEO015: ok
[  357.28-  360.00] FEE013: ok thank you very much
[  361.48-  363.92] FEE013: let us start from the inside and work our way out
[  363.56-  365.00] MEO015: right yeah ok
[  364.28-  365.82] MEE014: yeah ok
[  365.44-  369.44] FEE016: and if anyone has any questions about that not yet to text ok
[  367.56-  369.48] FEE013: yeah do not think so keep it out
[  371.04-  373.10] FEE013: yes thank you
[  380.96-  383.52] MEE014: let us go
[  381.16-  381.80] FEE016: ok
[  388.56-  389.72] FEE013: i hate those little things
[  390.00-  390.28] MEE014: yeah
[  390.96-  395.96] FEE013: specially if you do them on too tight and you can not get the leverage on them to undo them
[  395.40-  395.90] FEE016: ok
[  403.02-  404.54] MEE014: ok
[  410.80-  411.24] FEE013: ok
[  410.84-  420.00] MEE014: kay this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the
[  420.00-  425.00] MEE014: moment kay first the
[  426.24-  450.00] MEE014: into the method the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t v and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find also in this study i have looked into the availability of some of the materials cause some of the things that we looked at last time are not unfortunately are
[  450.00-  450.56] MEE014: available
[  451.06-  451.40] FEE013: kay
[  452.66-  478.52] MEE014: findings i have got my nice little picture there this is the chip called the t a double one eight three five which is what is used in pretty much every remote control cause it sends out standard signals based on your input and it is pretty much used for all all t v remotes at the moment and then we we are lu looking into battery options
[  472.18-  472.34] FEE013: yeah
[  480.00-  506.64] MEE014: there is actually no rechargeable option available so we i saw the the standard double a and triple a which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment dynamo charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest people wi it is it is basically like wind up radio so you wind up your remote control before you use it
[  497.44-  498.86] FEE013: can you explain that
[  500.12-  502.60] FEE013: ok right ok
[  504.94-  510.00] FEE013: how what kind of how long can you get out of that i mean can you pick it up and then what
[  510.00-  512.56] FEE013: wind it for two minutes and then that is it for the night or
[  512.14-  533.16] MEE014: y yeah yeah i presume you would not have to wind it for very long but i do not i do not think it is really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options like the the solar charging cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you have got t v
[  531.46-  532.94] FEE013: that is ok that would be good
[  532.32-  535.72] FEE016: you could light charge us us something like that or not
[  533.78-  537.80] FEE013: i thought it was a huge fee like a
[  535.18-  535.54] MEE014: no
[  536.90-  539.10] MEE014: is it oh right it
[  539.16-  540.00] FEE016: just to be silver
[  539.60-  540.00] FEE013: any
[  540.00-  540.84] FEE013: any
[  540.56-  552.16] MEO015: yeah regarding the sizes which one you think will be like because we we have to begin to the traditional size also so maybe it is standard triple a might take lesser space and dynamo might take most space
[  551.04-  557.24] MEE014: yeah it would the the yeah the dynamo would take more space cause you would actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up
[  557.00-  559.68] FEE013: i am pretty sure that solar is from the sun
[  559.76-  560.84] MEE014: yeah ok
[  560.54-  570.00] FEE013: i do not think it counts electric lights no but i mean not many you do not want to limit your market i mean people who live in the basement of plants there is
[  561.88-  563.04] FEE016: what a special idea
[  565.28-  566.02] FEE016: that is good too
[  570.00-  573.00] FEE013: not that many people but there are people
[  571.16-  575.32] FEE016: i know a different parts of the world if we are if we are marketing internationally
[  571.56-  571.74] MEO015: right
[  571.72-  571.92] MEE014: yeah
[  575.14-  580.40] MEE014: yeah and most people most people also watch t v in the in the night anyway
[  575.70-  575.94] MEO015: right
[  579.56-  580.20] MEO015: right
[  580.60-  588.72] FEE013: but then it would be charging through the day i think the point is it charges through the day and then you have got it charged now
[  587.24-  600.00] MEE014: but i i think i think the the next one is the best anyway the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in ri you get it in wristwatches and you you do not even notice it i mean the amount the amount
[  590.12-  590.60] FEE013: ok
[  595.40-  596.24] FEE013: yeah i see
[  600.00-  608.06] MEE014: of probably moving around you would be doing all the time would would charge it up i do not think you would ever need to actually physically start shaping it up to make it work
[  608.54-  613.52] MEO015: and are this like what is the like for the kinetic battery it like it runs for a long time
[  613.50-  630.00] MEE014: yeah it is it charges into some form of it is a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery cause they use them quite frequently in watches and that will that
[  627.88-  628.28] MEO015: ok
[  630.00-  640.40] MEE014: would l would last for well i do not i d i am not entirely sure how long it would last but i have never seen one run out
[  640.02-  657.18] FEE013: but then if you think about a watch it is on your wrist so it is on your whole bod it is on your body the whole time so you are walking around you are doing things it is moving a lot of the time if you are i mean you switch the t v on then you put it on the side then you pick it out to change it and then you put it on the side is it really going to be enough
[  645.12-  645.52] MEE014: yeah
[  649.90-  651.28] MEE014: yeah and
[  655.38-  660.00] MEE014: yeah but then again i i think it is because if you think about it the
[  660.00-  686.68] MEE014: watch although it is only a tiny amount it is it is it is always moving for the whole day and they do not run out overnight when you leave them on the side and the for the same the same reason you are only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you are finished with it and you put it no no i do i do not think the gerardic would be
[  672.44-  672.94] FEE013: ok
[  681.64-  690.00] FEE016: so it is not to draw on it is not it could i have to start referring back to solar charging is that compatible with
[  681.76-  683.44] FEE013: so it is not to draw on it is not
[  684.92-  685.40] FEE013: ok
[  690.00-  697.26] FEE016: standard batteries i mean could people put standard batteries in but with this you know they could leave it in the sun like for solar charging well the two things are not compatible
[  695.82-  715.00] MEE014: y yeah i think i would it c y you could have a dual power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because if you like in on a calculator they they are quite they are quite big and they all they all look identical
[  698.22-  699.60] FEE013: like a dual
[  710.58-  711.08] FEE016: yeah
[  714.48-  716.48] FEE016: so that affects the achieving design
[  715.28-  717.64] MEO015: so a lot would be expensive as well
[  716.16-  720.00] FEE013: expensive as well what kind of price are we looking at for
[  717.24-  719.00] MEE014: they are they are expensive they do not
[  720.00-  723.12] FEE013: i presume that normal batteries are the cheapest
[  720.58-  722.04] MEO015: heets
[  723.00-  731.28] MEE014: yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i would presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones but the
[  732.44-  748.50] MEE014: it is i think they are not very resistant to dropping cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have the size you would need to charge a remote would not be that big but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff so
[  738.34-  738.94] FEE013: sorry
[  740.28-  741.44] FEE013: but they are not designed
[  750.00-  751.56] FEE013: practical wise ok
[  750.00-  751.88] MEE014: i think yeah practically
[  753.64-  760.56] MEE014: i mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do they can do
[  759.16-  763.08] FEE013: could you get a bit of weird but do not calculators have a battery in there as well
[  762.40-  766.96] MEE014: yeah they do they yeah they have got dual things but the the battery is a small lot i think
[  764.84-  765.28] FEE013: oh
[  767.24-  774.60] MEO015: another question is like sorry w which one would last the longest because we do not want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day
[  767.34-  768.00] FEE016: yeah
[  774.96-  778.24] MEE014: yeah so the
[  775.96-  779.34] MEO015: or remote control like so we can just look at the life also
[  777.12-  777.28] FEE016: yeah
[  779.62-  780.00] MEE014: yeah
[  780.00-  784.80] MEE014: the this if you if you had something dual using the standard
[  786.00-  797.84] MEE014: batteries and the solar charging i do not think you would i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a s would last in or triple a s would last
[  796.50-  801.60] FEE016: it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature if it is not going to add anything ok
[  799.32-  801.96] MEE014: yeah i think it i think it would yeah
[  801.88-  806.28] FEE013: ok can we add in an attachment to clothing feature
[  806.96-  807.28] MEO015: ok
[  807.96-  810.00] FEE013: can we think about that cause if
[  810.00-  814.20] FEE013: if we are doing the kinetic thing and it is
[  811.76-  812.24] MEE014: yeah
[  812.32-  818.52] FEE016: should not we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right ok
[  816.28-  819.12] FEE013: well add it in to think about
[  821.88-  822.52] FEE013: because
[  823.70-  840.00] FEE013: where am i if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people do not do kind of we are doing something original and different
[  832.64-  833.00] MEE014: yeah
[  840.00-  848.18] FEE013: but if you wore it if it is something you could just click on your pocket then you would have that less you you would not lose it so much
[  847.24-  847.64] MEE014: yeah
[  849.52-  852.72] FEE013: but then maybe that is looking at someone who is just sitting on their own rather than
[  849.84-  850.14] MEE014: yeah
[  854.12-  856.60] FEE013: the eternal battle for control of the controls
[  857.16-  863.68] FEE016: it is not something that has come up in any of our focus groups and market research it is not thing that people are looking for
[  861.80-  862.36] FEE013: just more
[  864.04-  864.52] FEE013: ok
[  864.84-  866.44] FEE016: and we throw it open to the field you know
[  865.28-  865.64] MEO015: fool
[  868.04-  870.00] FEE016: it is something to put on the side to think about the
[  868.04-  868.50] MEE014: ok
[  870.00-  870.20] FEE016: oh
[  871.64-  872.36] FEE013: ok right
[  872.20-  873.28] MEE014: ok well i will move on
[  874.84-  900.00] MEE014: my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicon p c b board which print printed circuit board which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button it will connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to to
[  900.00-  917.68] MEE014: two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it is fired out of this l e d and a sequence of on and off bursts
[  918.16-  928.04] FEE013: what kind of things do we have to consider there can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
[  925.26-  925.60] MEE014: well
[  927.14-  930.00] MEE014: well the the thi the thing about it is
[  931.56-  960.00] MEE014: they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because can can print a circuit board like that the it is it is simply spaced like that so can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in if if see how thin the tracks are could could s could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if if wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that or could
[  952.22-  952.62] FEE013: ok
[  960.00-  962.16] MEE014: have some sort of
[  963.60-  967.48] MEE014: array of switches which i will speak about in the next bit so that
[  966.52-  966.92] FEE013: ok
[  969.08-  990.00] MEE014: and then to yeah so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a stand by mode note while not being used now what i was thinking about that was cause sometimes when y when you have these things they have got little lights on behind the buttons so you could see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone you do it more often than i am
[  987.44-  987.82] FEE013: ok
[  990.00- 1003.04] MEE014: than on a t v remote but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i would d have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up
[ 1004.88- 1005.48] MEO015: yeah
[ 1004.92- 1020.00] MEE014: the case material i have been sent what the factory can actually give us the there is the plastic which i think we were going to go for anyway has the
[ 1020.00- 1023.28] MEE014: the main case case housing and
[ 1024.60- 1050.00] MEE014: the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit of impractical titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber well you are saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps some
[ 1046.72- 1047.08] FEE016: yeah
[ 1050.00- 1056.50] MEE014: some something made of rubber but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they have they have said
[ 1057.86- 1060.24] MEE014: that they have they have put across
[ 1061.52- 1080.00] MEE014: are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it is meant to be anti r s i i am not i am not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that is what they said
[ 1080.00- 1084.82] MEE014: the problem with the casing is that there is
[ 1086.08- 1109.20] MEE014: quite there is quite a few design restrictions that they have got on the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes but whether whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
[ 1111.24- 1128.60] MEO015: second question yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the cover call it a skin or whatever so in this case if you are looking at like a customer can change the color like from green parrot green to chili red or something like that so is that feature available in like titanium or it is like only specific to plastic
[ 1111.36- 1112.42] MEE014: for the flick flame
[ 1111.46- 1112.76] FEE013: in english yeah
[ 1116.00- 1116.40] MEE014: yeah
[ 1121.34- 1121.56] FEE016: yeah
[ 1123.20- 1123.84] MEE014: yeah i th
[ 1128.24- 1140.00] MEE014: yeah in in titanium i do not i do not think it would be available at all really the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy in
[ 1132.20- 1132.30] FEE016: yeah
[ 1140.00- 1151.00] MEE014: new case for it because of the expense of how much titanium is it is it is light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a
[ 1152.10- 1169.80] FEE016: it does work quite easily too if you let it fall i have got a mobile phone myself which is to tiny in and it does mark very easily or drop it i was just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that could cover that give the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different questions because
[ 1152.44- 1153.12] MEE014: for a remote
[ 1156.72- 1158.52] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1163.88- 1165.12] MEE014: rubber yeah
[ 1168.64- 1170.00] MEE014: and you can peel them off yeah
[ 1170.00- 1180.84] FEE013: so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber like those pens that you get with the grip that you can you can pull that off
[ 1170.00- 1170.20] MEO015: yeah
[ 1174.30- 1176.00] FEE016: like the rusty of rust yeah
[ 1176.04- 1176.74] MEE014: yeah
[ 1176.08- 1176.80] MEO015: yeah ok
[ 1178.32- 1178.66] MEE014: yeah
[ 1178.54- 1178.94] FEE016: yeah
[ 1178.62- 1180.68] MEO015: alright that could be a good idea
[ 1181.92- 1183.96] MEO015: it would it would be comfortable to hold on also
[ 1182.08- 1182.52] FEE013: ok
[ 1184.80- 1184.92] MEE014: j
[ 1184.94- 1188.36] FEE016: very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one for them to
[ 1187.76- 1188.24] MEE014: yeah
[ 1188.72- 1192.64] FEE013: well that has been really popular with mobile phones so i do not see why not
[ 1191.82- 1193.20] FEE016: do not see why not yeah
[ 1193.72- 1200.00] MEE014: also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons the
[ 1195.06- 1195.48] FEE013: kay
[ 1200.00- 1219.56] MEE014: i know we were planning to do some sort of touch screen now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p c b circuit board and i am sure you could probably get it in different colors and so just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection
[ 1220.72- 1230.00] MEE014: over if you had them close enough that would be one option the second option they offer rubber buttons but i thought that an l
[ 1230.00- 1249.58] MEE014: c d type of screen cause one they are incredibly thin and do not take up much space two they you can have them in a sort of array and you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
[ 1250.60- 1253.08] MEO015: sorry i put it to the last part you took now
[ 1250.92- 1251.56] MEE014: display
[ 1254.32- 1255.52] MEE014: what what
[ 1255.66- 1259.32] MEO015: just what you said i did not get the meaning of it completely you are saying that
[ 1259.12- 1260.00] MEE014: oh on the on the
[ 1260.00- 1278.28] MEE014: the l c d screen you could be c you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it is flat and so you can not do lots of curved curved things with it but you can you would not have with the l c d you would have the wires coming off you would not have that with the
[ 1268.12- 1268.44] MEO015: ok
[ 1279.40- 1282.12] MEE014: with the l c d you would only have that with the printed circuit board
[ 1283.20- 1283.72] MEE014: with
[ 1285.04- 1286.50] MEE014: also with the
[ 1285.16- 1290.00] FEE016: i do not s sorry to interrupt i do not see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example had
[ 1290.00- 1294.32] FEE016: to show oh it would be a flat yeah yeah yeah
[ 1290.80- 1291.38] MEE014: yeah
[ 1291.40- 1292.92] FEE013: oh it would be flat inside yeah
[ 1292.64- 1311.88] MEE014: you could have a flat screen inside yeah but i am just wondering whether we want an l c d screen inside it would not be like full color it would just be black and white but there would be touch touch buttons so you would not be pressing down on them w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r s i
[ 1295.96- 1297.08] FEE016: but then a flat description
[ 1305.92- 1306.16] MEO015: f
[ 1312.32- 1320.00] FEE013: i think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing is going to be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see some
[ 1316.18- 1316.78] MEE014: rubber
[ 1320.00- 1327.54] FEE013: something quite fancy looking inside now how would you distinguish if you had it there how would you distinguish where you had to press i mean
[ 1321.04- 1321.36] FEE016: yeah
[ 1328.40- 1331.40] MEE014: yeah i had not i had not really thought that to be honest
[ 1329.08- 1329.34] FEE013: i
[ 1329.80- 1345.40] FEE016: i just have another idea i do not know if it helps with that but just to do with the r s i is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing where you can actually make it really yeah
[ 1341.30- 1350.00] MEE014: yeah you could you could have some sort of stylist that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost if
[ 1343.28- 1344.64] FEE013: a sort of palm of that thing
[ 1349.52- 1350.00] FEE016: yeah
[ 1349.88- 1350.00] MEO015: yeah
[ 1350.00- 1352.32] FEE016: cause it is easy to replay that as well as it is cheap
[ 1350.00- 1367.40] MEO015: cause if you have to be for somebody who serves very often if you would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often he will find it very irritating to use early you know and he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like if you keep punching with an point or whatever
[ 1350.44- 1352.34] FEE013: but we had to replay that or should we
[ 1357.40- 1357.76] MEE014: yeah
[ 1360.12- 1360.72] MEE014: yeah
[ 1364.52- 1364.96] MEE014: yeah
[ 1364.92- 1365.16] FEE016: yeah
[ 1367.68- 1368.56] MEE014: yeah ok
[ 1368.02- 1373.96] FEE016: yeah just i thought they would not actually need one in the keys anything they have got could not they a pencil a pen so they would not really need a
[ 1374.36- 1380.00] FEE013: ok we will talk about that so if you finish your and i will come back to that that is your
[ 1377.38- 1380.00] MEE014: yeah that is yeah that that is the end of
[ 1380.00- 1381.32] FEE013: right ok
[ 1380.00- 1380.72] MEE014: y yes
[ 1380.42- 1393.04] MEO015: you have done small question before like you are this thing regarding the circuit since we have having having a clip top we can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the whole complex buttons are these things so we can divide the circuit like you know
[ 1385.08- 1385.28] MEE014: yeah
[ 1389.90- 1390.70] MEE014: oh yeah
[ 1393.64- 1410.00] MEE014: yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple i mean you would a you would actually have two separate you would have two separate circuit boards but they would be joined by wires or like some cabling between them cause in the in the actual flip bit you would have
[ 1395.96- 1396.18] MEO015: yeah
[ 1398.68- 1398.96] MEO015: yeah
[ 1403.88- 1404.16] MEO015: kay
[ 1410.00- 1411.12] MEE014: have some linking
[ 1413.28- 1427.96] FEE016: i just raise another point where it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here i am not sure how it would fit in if we flip open now you know how you have got some mirrors in night gloves that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display have you seen those
[ 1417.86- 1418.40] MEE014: yeah
[ 1427.92- 1428.44] FEE013: yeah
[ 1428.92- 1440.00] FEE016: and they kind of respond to the turn of your body is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it is a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the the of them
[ 1440.00- 1441.02] FEE016: control display then
[ 1441.56- 1444.96] FEE013: we are marketing to guys as much as we are to women
[ 1441.72- 1442.16] MEE014: ok
[ 1445.32- 1446.38] FEE016: they do not look at themselves
[ 1447.72- 1448.36] FEE016: just a thought
[ 1448.66- 1457.68] FEE013: well it is a remote control you are sitting watching t v are you going to want to sort of open it and say oh you should should go and have a shower and do a hair recorder for the t
[ 1451.08- 1451.58] FEE016: yeah
[ 1453.40- 1466.12] FEE016: i know what you mean so there is using the ideas from mobile phones so there is using the ideas from mobile phones we have kind of got a fine tacked onto that i think i am just trying to think of other features we can build in that would not cost too much we will maybe leave that one on the side
[ 1459.52- 1461.52] FEE013: yeah i know yeah
[ 1466.12- 1466.64] MEE014: yeah
[ 1467.28- 1467.80] FEE016: kay
[ 1467.48- 1467.92] FEE013: ok
[ 1469.38- 1470.00] MEE014: i mean you can
[ 1470.00- 1482.18] MEE014: and you could do it you could have a cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l c d display or completely blank it out but i do not know if you could get any mirror effect on that on the whole show
[ 1481.16- 1485.30] FEE016: i do not forget about the mirror that would just be very quite fancy for the mirror
[ 1484.52- 1485.96] FEE013: ok ok
[ 1485.92- 1487.38] MEO015: ok
[ 1489.98- 1500.00] MEO015: i want to share something which i did here first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the
[ 1500.00- 1521.16] MEO015: needs and feasibility second is we check into competitors the picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here so y you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are bored of black and white so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here
[ 1510.40- 1510.76] FEE013: yeah
[ 1515.72- 1516.08] MEE014: yeah
[ 1522.92- 1529.04] MEO015: and second thing is there is too much of confusion here no particular remote is standard
[ 1527.28- 1527.80] FEE013: yeah
[ 1531.18- 1532.80] MEO015: like some some people have
[ 1534.58- 1537.40] MEO015: here you see this this is on i i
[ 1538.58- 1547.98] MEO015: i found out that only common feature is the ch channel control and the volume control whereas other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with with other models and all
[ 1548.32- 1548.70] FEE013: kay
[ 1549.28- 1560.00] MEO015: ok and second as already discussed with william we are going to have m maybe a g u g u i interface in the in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface
[ 1555.92- 1556.22] MEE014: yeah
[ 1557.60- 1558.80] FEE016: sorry what does that is going to be
[ 1558.24- 1559.20] FEE013: which means
[ 1560.00- 1564.64] MEO015: basically which is what we do do in computer have icons or touch pad or whatever which is
[ 1560.36- 1560.52] FEE016: s
[ 1562.32- 1562.72] MEE014: yeah
[ 1564.18- 1569.12] MEE014: if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen and this l c d screen
[ 1568.90- 1575.38] MEO015: like you have on a l icons or something you have is a good example of g u i graphic user interface
[ 1574.84- 1575.70] MEE014: yeah
[ 1575.52- 1575.92] FEE013: ok
[ 1576.34- 1579.12] MEO015: so basically a person need not point or click on it s
[ 1580.12- 1590.00] MEO015: press any d particular device he just has to click on that particular icon just simplify and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing you know could be on the
[ 1582.98- 1583.28] FEE013: ok
[ 1590.00- 1597.76] MEO015: pointing device that means user button so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle
[ 1598.78- 1607.80] MEO015: so we are having a combination of both so on the s simpler board on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels
[ 1609.44- 1614.28] FEE013: can we swap that round so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part
[ 1615.64- 1617.44] FEE013: cause if you are thinking about holding it
[ 1618.76- 1620.00] FEE013: you would be using yourself
[ 1620.00- 1622.84] FEE013: mose to press just like a mobile phone
[ 1622.52- 1623.40] MEE014: yeah
[ 1622.56- 1624.88] FEE016: no you would fold it you know if you would flip it open and you would be
[ 1627.04- 1636.60] FEE016: would not you is not like the idea you if if we just use the shell as an example of it and you open that you have got your l c d display there and you have got the buttons there and you are holding the button it is just so yeah
[ 1630.76- 1631.32] FEE013: yeah
[ 1635.08- 1638.04] MEE014: yeah yeah but you can do with your thumb lot
[ 1635.32- 1650.00] FEE013: that is what i was just saying and then have the and then have the the l c d at the top and then be able to touch that for the other computers so have the the volume and the program and things like that
[ 1636.80- 1636.92] MEO015: what
[ 1643.44- 1644.68] MEO015: ok so
[ 1649.48- 1650.00] MEO015: and the load
[ 1650.00- 1652.40] FEE013: on the lower side ok
[ 1650.00- 1651.64] MEO015: is it oh perfect
[ 1651.84- 1651.94] FEE016: ok
[ 1655.62- 1657.74] MEO015: so the findings are too many cluttered buttons
[ 1658.64- 1669.12] MEO015: repetition of certain bat patterns which i already explained example the volume and channel control buttons all are confusing and in inconsistent ok we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a mail
[ 1670.48- 1680.00] MEO015: which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature we have to check into the f financial feasibility whether we can
[ 1680.00- 1706.64] MEO015: and incorporate the t this at a low cost but for like we had a s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also
[ 1690.12- 1690.48] MEE014: yeah
[ 1694.76- 1695.18] MEE014: yeah
[ 1708.38- 1708.78] MEE014: yeah
[ 1708.98- 1710.00] MEO015: so we we can check
[ 1710.00- 1712.44] MEO015: into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
[ 1716.22- 1731.80] MEO015: my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by m marketing department they want something to do with fruit so i would not say their design should be like a fruit but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors red chili
[ 1730.76- 1731.04] MEE014: yeah
[ 1733.00- 1740.00] MEO015: tomato red or whatever and second thing is certain certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you
[ 1740.00- 1742.36] MEO015: see the previous slide
[ 1743.54- 1745.16] MEE014: well yeah we
[ 1746.08- 1757.20] MEO015: i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this sort central pattern here so we we will not change that particular pattern because it it this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
[ 1751.16- 1751.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 1757.44- 1760.08] FEE013: i can not see the is that play and stop and things
[ 1760.16- 1770.00] MEO015: this is the central one the one the yeah volume and channel so keep that m that standardized because that is the most common feature across all models if you look at all
[ 1761.44- 1763.44] FEE013: or is that volume and channel
[ 1770.00- 1771.06] MEO015: the models it is here
[ 1773.64- 1774.18] MEO015: this
[ 1776.98- 1777.56] MEO015: and
[ 1780.80- 1781.56] MEO015: voice recognition
[ 1782.76- 1783.24] FEE013: ok
[ 1787.76- 1790.68] FEE013: right ok
[ 1792.02- 1798.44] FEE013: i am not sure how lot we have got left but we need to make a decision about
[ 1801.06- 1802.00] FEE013: the things we discussed
[ 1802.70- 1806.28] FEE013: so we agree on
[ 1807.80- 1809.00] FEE013: do we agree on the battery
[ 1809.80- 1810.40] FEE016: i know
[ 1810.14- 1810.80] MEO015: that kind of
[ 1811.44- 1826.88] FEE013: yeah that means that there is no function for the port you know that it sits in then pressing button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for finding it it is a it is it is like a g it is a gadget it is a
[ 1811.56- 1812.06] MEE014: yeah
[ 1819.92- 1820.48] MEE014: yeah
[ 1822.96- 1824.70] MEE014: yeah i think i mean it
[ 1827.08- 1830.00] MEE014: yeah it is it is quite it is quite a cool feature to
[ 1828.06- 1828.92] FEE013: selling point
[ 1830.00- 1847.92] MEE014: have and also if they have got it if they have got these parts already in stock then it will not be cheap to remanufacturing it will it will be cheap though to remanufacturing so do you reckon that is a good idea that where is the remote i am here thing i think that would be quite fun
[ 1848.00- 1849.20] FEE013: i think the only
[ 1850.32- 1860.00] FEE013: i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it is going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else but i think pretty much
[ 1855.20- 1855.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 1860.00- 1866.56] FEE013: we have used cheap relatively cheap and simple things the l c d is not cheap
[ 1863.14- 1863.52] MEE014: yeah
[ 1864.20- 1864.60] FEE016: it is simple
[ 1865.00- 1876.68] MEE014: yeah well it is it is not as expensive as it would be if it was full color cause if we have just got a black and white one i mean they use them in calculators so
[ 1866.88- 1867.12] FEE016: yeah
[ 1876.52- 1877.64] FEE013: yeah ok
[ 1877.46- 1879.24] MEO015: maybe we could start with the black and white
[ 1880.02- 1880.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 1880.72- 1883.08] MEO015: that that would be good upgrade later on up
[ 1880.80- 1881.96] FEE013: and you could yeah
[ 1883.70- 1889.58] FEE016: yeah d we talked about kinetic charging we have deci we seem to have decided on that did we decide on double a or triple a batteries
[ 1884.08- 1884.56] FEE013: ok
[ 1890.54- 1892.28] MEE014: what you
[ 1891.64- 1893.12] FEE013: do you want like a backup
[ 1893.88- 1900.92] FEE016: no one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a or triple a batteries cause they have still got to be charged this way have not they oh i see
[ 1899.26- 1905.02] MEE014: no the kinetic ones come come with a sort of watch a battery that goes in the watch
[ 1905.08- 1906.08] FEE016: right ok got me
[ 1906.14- 1908.42] MEE014: so it is a lot smaller than that so it would
[ 1908.40- 1910.62] FEE016: got you on now ok
[ 1912.74- 1920.00] FEE013: ok so we have got the battery the inside components is pretty standardized across the board
[ 1920.00- 1920.62] FEE013: is not it
[ 1921.16- 1921.78] MEE014: yeah
[ 1921.80- 1922.08] MEO015: yeah
[ 1921.88- 1925.92] FEE013: so there is not a really a decision to be made there
[ 1928.08- 1931.10] FEE013: the buttons what did you give us as a
[ 1934.74- 1936.92] FEE013: the bare board l c d are
[ 1936.36- 1947.70] MEE014: yeah the i think we will we are going for the l c d on that one on the buttons on the on the on on the top one yeah
[ 1944.72- 1949.36] FEE013: on the top one ok you have got the touch ok and then
[ 1950.00- 1955.16] MEE014: on the bottom we were going to have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r s r ones
[ 1956.54- 1958.48] FEE013: ok ok
[ 1959.76- 1961.70] FEE016: sorry could you repeat that last part
[ 1961.78- 1970.20] MEE014: ok on we have got the flip the flip screen the top one is going to be the l c d and the bottom one is going to be the rubberized buttons
[ 1963.64- 1964.64] FEE016: like the l c d
[ 1965.56- 1965.88] FEE016: oh
[ 1969.84- 1970.40] FEE016: ok
[ 1971.44- 1972.60] MEO015: and for the so
[ 1973.36- 1974.16] FEE013: no it is fine
[ 1977.08- 1980.00] MEO015: for the body design i think plastic
[ 1980.00- 1987.82] MEO015: yeah you could use the body for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the tricks something like to add to the design
[ 1980.20- 1981.62] MEE014: plastic ok
[ 1981.56- 1982.56] FEE013: for the inside
[ 1983.34- 1983.80] MEE014: yeah
[ 1988.20- 1993.76] FEE016: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell the the the lines ok
[ 1991.72- 1992.64] MEO015: that is right
[ 1992.24- 1993.92] FEE013: oh i think so i think so
[ 1995.96- 2008.32] FEE016: and it is just a much rubberized and spongy apart from that we are just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors we are not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else in the shell we are just going to have a different color
[ 2006.04- 2006.48] MEE014: yeah
[ 2007.04- 2010.00] FEE013: no i think i i we do not want to be tacky
[ 2008.16- 2008.68] MEO015: it is
[ 2010.00- 2036.62] FEE013: if we have got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap so we could make it red we could make it psychedelic you know we could make it black and white zebra stripes but that is not really what we are focusing on what we are focusing on is the m you know yes so we could just pick anything
[ 2010.38- 2010.94] FEE016: ok
[ 2031.80- 2032.28] FEE016: the feeling
[ 2034.76- 2035.14] FEE016: ok
[ 2036.88- 2040.00] FEE016: is that going to be this image i have got in my head
[ 2040.00- 2056.36] FEE016: of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubberized cover that is spongy is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted margaret is that fancy look and feel
[ 2055.20- 2070.00] FEE013: it is just different it is just different from everything else and i mean i am trying to imagine clean looking houses sort of beige and black so you either want something that goes
[ 2055.44- 2057.28] MEO015: i think it is super
[ 2063.56- 2063.96] FEE016: ok
[ 2070.00- 2083.08] FEE013: with that which is what is on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they are so interesting and
[ 2071.56- 2072.64] FEE016: yeah yeah
[ 2078.48- 2078.84] FEE016: yeah
[ 2080.86- 2081.12] FEE016: yeah
[ 2082.30- 2094.40] FEE016: just kinda pushing it and not to see if you came out with anything else but i mean i totally agree we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things this would definitely be different enough i just wonder if anybody could come up with something similar
[ 2090.18- 2090.64] FEE013: yeah
[ 2094.28- 2100.00] FEE013: and you would just have a a cross the po you would have so many different options that you could do
[ 2100.00- 2106.96] FEE013: you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
[ 2105.52- 2117.88] FEE016: we think these are operative covers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce that if in a year is time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming out it is so easy for us to produce that that can be slipped on and one is another beauty of it
[ 2113.86- 2114.36] FEE013: yeah
[ 2116.30- 2130.00] FEE013: and ones that ones that have rubbery spikes y you know you could just go so far with it like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that is quite a flexible
[ 2116.50- 2116.72] MEO015: right
[ 2121.36- 2122.20] MEE014: you can
[ 2122.88- 2124.92] MEO015: a cup of pressure yeah
[ 2123.64- 2123.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 2128.76- 2129.18] MEE014: yeah
[ 2130.00- 2131.76] FEE013: oh
[ 2130.84- 2141.02] MEO015: and finally the body should be detachable maybe ch you can change the body of the case casing the case outside it should be more really with the design in such a way you can change it every time
[ 2136.68- 2137.20] FEE013: yes
[ 2141.32- 2151.32] MEE014: yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized case not the actual plastic outside case just the rubber thing that goes around it
[ 2145.44- 2145.80] FEE013: yeah
[ 2148.20- 2149.66] MEO015: ok the rubber
[ 2149.62- 2149.88] FEE013: yeah
[ 2152.26- 2157.10] FEE013: ok we have got five minutes well that might have been up for a while
[ 2156.44- 2160.00] FEE016: alright so can i just recap for syra
[ 2156.56- 2156.80] MEO015: oh
[ 2159.26- 2159.48] MEO015: yeah
[ 2160.00- 2178.52] FEE016: the decisions that we have made kinetic charging the watch type batteries l c d display on the the top side of the flip top rubberized buttons on the bottom side we are going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic that is how far we have got what else do we have to add to our decisions here
[ 2180.24- 2189.92] MEO015: fine we are talking of voice recognition also because that we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it is lost
[ 2190.82- 2193.06] MEO015: so are you looking at voice recognition
[ 2190.96- 2196.36] FEE016: yeah we are just we are just a cost issue with that but it is a good idea we just need to check on the cost does not we
[ 2195.78- 2199.80] MEO015: or maybe like william was suggesting the last thing some devices you put on keychains
[ 2201.36- 2208.12] MEO015: for yeah the whistle so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
[ 2201.54- 2203.24] MEE014: oh yeah yeah the whistle ones yeah
[ 2217.04- 2219.64] FEE016: and incorporating the company logo
[ 2220.58- 2220.76] MEO015: yeah
[ 2221.32- 2222.08] FEE013: have you
[ 2222.60- 2225.40] MEO015: so i mentioned that but if you will be incorporating in the design
[ 2225.72- 2235.84] FEE016: as i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from it from your report it is not just a case of having a little r r fitting somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it is our product
[ 2226.58- 2227.16] FEE013: ok
[ 2235.56- 2250.00] FEE013: well they do but i think we can well it is it is i think you just address that with advertising you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work
[ 2238.38- 2241.18] FEE016: cause it is the only one of its kind on the market i think it is going to be
[ 2247.84- 2248.36] MEE014: yeah
[ 2248.52- 2248.92] FEE016: ok
[ 2250.00- 2260.56] FEE013: for you obviously you will have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it the point is that it has got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i am not worried about that
[ 2257.10- 2257.56] FEE016: ok
[ 2260.30- 2268.42] FEE016: ok did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper i think that was you talked about a beeper for location have we just rejected that in failure of noise recognition
[ 2268.76- 2276.40] FEE013: depending on how i i mean we have got this memo saying that it is something that the company is looking into so
[ 2269.86- 2271.64] MEE014: yeah depending on the expense of it
[ 2276.08- 2277.80] MEE014: that have got in stock so yeah
[ 2280.00- 2293.24] FEE013: turns out that it is hugely expensive we would have to cut down somewhere else then it is worth thinking about but i think we will find out more about cost afterwards right i am going to wrap it up there
[ 2288.76- 2289.04] MEE014: yeah
[ 2291.54- 2291.88] MEE014: ok
[ 2295.08- 2295.60] MEO015: ok
[ 2296.32- 2303.34] FEE013: i got our end meeting now message on my phone so i will
[ 2298.52- 2298.98] MEO015: yeah
[ 2299.36- 2299.96] MEE014: ok
[ 2300.18- 2300.92] MEO015: yeah
[ 2302.56- 2303.56] MEO015: yeah
[ 2305.18- 2310.00] FEE013: so i think we have probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so i
[ 2306.68- 2307.56] FEE016: that is good
[ 2310.00- 2312.56] FEE013: think we probably got about that time before we come back
[ 2314.36- 2315.24] FEE013: it is either that or
[ 2316.24- 2321.10] FEE013: we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and i do not know how long that took even
[ 2321.72- 2323.96] MEO015: i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
[ 2325.44- 2325.60] FEE016: yeah
[ 2325.44- 2325.60] MEE014: yeah
[ 2325.90- 2326.76] FEE013: is everyone happy
[ 2328.56- 2329.12] FEE016: lunch was good
[ 2328.56- 2329.12] MEE014: lunch was good
[ 2331.26- 2331.80] FEE013: ok
[ 2333.72- 2334.20] FEE016: ok
[ 2333.72- 2334.20] MEE014: ok

============================================================
SESSION: ES2004d
============================================================

[    3.68-    6.86] FEE013: if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time
[   15.10-   16.00] FEE016: sauce
[   19.94-   20.74] FEE013: is that
[   23.00-   23.44] MEO015: thank you
[   24.12-   25.26] FEE013: it would be apparently
[   27.38-   28.56] FEE013: ok you all switched
[   27.86-   28.38] FEE016: i switched up
[   29.06-   29.64] MEO015: yeah
[   32.72-   35.52] FEE013: ok we are good to go ok
[   36.64-   39.52] FEE013: minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger
[   40.92-   45.64] FEE013: standard chip cause it can come in various different sizes it was not a
[   47.08-   60.00] FEE013: going to be a problem factor we wanted a standby function the case material is going to be soft rubbery changeable buttons with a combination of l c d and rubber according to
[   60.00-   82.48] FEE013: design bright funky designs inspired by a fruit keeping with the hip kind of feel and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that and the rubber buttons that we use will be anti r s i ok
[   88.58-   90.00] FEE013: prototype presentation
[   91.36-   92.62] MEE014: is that m for us
[   92.60-   93.80] FEE013: i think that would be you
[   92.84-   93.32] MEO015: yeah
[   94.10-   94.48] MEE014: ok
[   94.68-   98.96] MEO015: me and william worked on a prototype and i think william is going to make a presently time
[   99.48-  109.38] MEE014: yeah shall i show i will show or do you do you want to do you want to show it or do you want to hold it and i will i will save the presentation do you want i just nick it
[  100.76-  101.10] MEO015: yeah
[  103.24-  105.52] FEE013: make sure you like annie
[  103.62-  104.68] MEO015: i can hold it like
[  106.04-  107.40] MEO015: yeah
[  109.00-  110.86] FEE013: yes yes you can but it is a i will get it out
[  114.80-  115.32] MEE014: whoa
[  115.96-  116.56] MEO015: it looks
[  116.04-  116.32] FEE013: yeah
[  116.54-  117.74] MEE014: kay we are crazy over here
[  117.88-  118.82] MEO015: very good idea
[  119.24-  119.68] FEE013: right
[  120.76-  121.40] MEE014: thank you
[  125.40-  131.36] FEE013: you should have one last things and you can just take it off
[  127.16-  127.52] MEO015: yes
[  129.84-  130.10] MEO015: right
[  132.10-  134.52] MEO015: oh where are the hinges
[  138.62-  150.00] MEE014: ok so this is our look and feel presentation final our final presentation and we will first look at the exterior of what we have come up with over there
[  139.40-  139.74] FEE013: right
[  141.72-  142.16] FEE013: ok
[  150.00-  180.00] MEE014: it is going to have a a plastic body with a sort of standard color either we are thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something this is underneath the rubberized the rubberized outer casing which there would be sort of a wide choice they would be attached but we can we can not come up with it
[  153.04-  153.88] MEO015: yeah
[  155.56-  155.92] MEO015: yep
[  178.12-  178.46] FEE013: ok
[  180.00-  202.58] MEE014: the wide choice of colors and sort of patterns so you have got you have got a lot of customisation with it it is obviously an a sort of clamshell design and the the top l c d screen that you can see there would would be sort of
[  204.26-  209.96] MEE014: how do you say it is yeah yeah it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the
[  204.78-  207.52] MEO015: the black and white touch screen for people is face
[  209.04-  209.96] FEE013: yeah it is set to the
[  210.00-  210.50] FEE013: oh
[  210.00-  233.98] MEE014: arms at the bottom would d so so it will fully close flat yeah yeah and working on the inside we have already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually thinking about it now c you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get the
[  211.04-  211.32] MEO015: right
[  214.92-  216.00] FEE013: oh right ok yeah
[  233.26-  238.76] FEE013: so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section cause it is the top part that is ok
[  236.06-  236.42] MEO015: yeah
[  240.00-  257.80] MEE014: we decided that the voice recognition system it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of so we presumed that they would also be quite cheap so you would have something like where you would shout out where where is the remote and
[  259.12-  261.28] MEE014: it will shout back i am here or something
[  264.58-  270.00] MEE014: and then yeah it w it will not shout out i am here or something it will just
[  264.76-  267.08] FEE016: or something
[  270.00-  300.00] MEE014: chart i am here or something to similar effect yeah if it was getting there i d well that that could be something for next time maybe you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is the standard there is be a standard transmission with the t v using using all the standard chips that we have talked about it would it would have obviously cause it is split over two two different layers it would need two separate p c v s that would be joint
[  271.08-  273.50] FEE013: ok i am under the sofa
[  271.76-  272.08] MEO015: ok
[  274.28-  275.32] MEO015: that is ok
[  274.64-  275.92] FEE013: oh that would be too complicated
[  291.24-  292.62] FEE013: i am not worried it is not true
[  300.00-  318.36] MEE014: point at the hinge through some sort of cabling and because obviously all t v s use this the same infrared medium we would just be using using the same thing to transmit the data and the infrared
[  319.88-  329.72] MEE014: the sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer just at the front of the we have not i do not think we had to put it on
[  329.08-  329.72] FEE013: i see you
[  330.80-  332.10] MEE014: yeah yeah something like that
[  332.10-  338.40] FEE013: kay actually no it would be it would have to be on the on the front oh right yeah ok got you
[  332.28-  335.32] MEO015: infrared could be yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[  334.20-  336.52] MEE014: yeah on the front on the front side of that yeah
[  337.52-  341.96] MEO015: so whenever it is when if it is open here the signal is pointing yeah
[  339.80-  341.52] FEE013: it is still pointing yes
[  339.90-  358.14] MEE014: so when you have actually got it open it would be facing the t v and then finally on the interface the top screen as we have said is would be an inset black and white l c d s touch screen which yeah would
[  342.36-  343.36] FEE013: yeah that makes sense
[  356.66-  357.40] MEO015: right yeah
[  359.30-  360.00] MEE014: have
[  360.00-  390.00] MEE014: all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it whereas the bo the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons like the vo volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and things to that effect and now we have we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have some some kind of s sort
[  375.28-  375.70] FEE013: ok
[  390.00-  390.88] MEE014: bezzled
[  392.40-  397.84] MEE014: logo on it or something in se or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
[  398.96-  399.56] MEO015: which is
[  399.04-  402.96] FEE013: but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product uses
[  400.04-  417.08] MEE014: no not not actually no not interfering with the l the whole look of the the product when it is out on the thing and finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics as that is that is the company logo
[  400.96-  401.28] MEO015: yeah
[  404.82-  405.56] MEO015: look of the
[  405.44-  405.78] FEE013: ok
[  413.44-  415.10] FEE013: thank you very much
[  415.28-  416.22] MEO015: yeah
[  416.52-  420.00] FEE013: wrapping it all up ok i have
[  417.12-  418.06] FEE016: oh
[  420.00-  422.00] FEE013: now got evaluation criteria
[  422.20-  422.74] FEE016: certainly
[  424.26-  427.56] MEO015: can you just use the one or
[  427.08-  450.00] FEE013: step one two three
[  428.80-  431.04] MEE014: ok thank you
[  428.82-  430.88] FEE016: ok thank you
[  438.46-  439.06] MEO015: ok
[  448.34-  450.00] MEO015: ok i think this moves a bit
[  450.00-  450.36] MEO015: yeah
[  452.26-  454.16] FEE013: it is quite similar to what it was before though
[  454.20-  480.00] FEE016: ok sorry this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research so this is the first stage of the evaluation now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing
[  455.38-  455.64] FEE013: sorry
[  480.00-  486.20] FEE016: strategy of our company so it is what we have discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those trends and requirements
[  488.36-  510.00] FEE016: now the findings that we came up with just a recap are here the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones that were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colors the design should minimize r and m
[  510.00-  523.18] FEE016: si and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there though that did seem to be the favored strategy but there was also on the sideline a thought of maybe having a beeper function
[  525.04-  540.00] FEE016: ok so we can come back to that slide if you do not have a note of those i will just show you how we are going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far we are going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false we will look at each of those
[  540.00-  550.80] FEE016: criteria that i have just mentioned i will call that slide back up and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here does that seem clear any questions there
[  543.84-  544.44] MEE014: yeah
[  548.50-  548.84] MEO015: ok
[  550.78-  551.82] MEO015: oh just go
[  552.40-  553.76] FEE016: so we are going to look at these
[  553.36-  556.20] MEO015: is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the
[  555.20-  565.20] FEE016: yes we are going to come to we will discuss each one and we will come to a consensus rating between one and seven ok one is true seven is false
[  558.24-  558.68] FEE013: yeah
[  561.86-  562.20] FEE013: ok
[  562.82-  563.02] MEO015: ok
[  567.16-  570.00] FEE016: right so i will write
[  570.00-  584.16] FEE016: all of that out again but it will just be criteria one two three four five six or a b c d e f to confuse it with the numerator a c d e f this is where everyone says tanya actually at
[  584.38-  585.32] FEE013: just write smiling
[  586.32-  587.20] FEE016: criteria
[  591.00-  592.04] FEE016: and rating
[  595.76-  600.00] FEE016: actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating we could take a average at the
[  600.00-  608.96] FEE016: end however that ok so i will just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go one two three four we know who is who
[  600.78-  602.04] FEE013: yeah if that works
[  600.96-  602.12] MEO015: yeah that is a good
[  601.00-  601.68] MEE014: yeah i would say
[  607.68-  607.92] MEE014: yeah
[  616.02-  630.00] FEE016: ok the criteria a the fancy look and feel how do we feel about this prototype model related to fancy it is a fancy look and feel one is true seven is false my own ratings that
[  630.00-  631.40] FEE016: that would be a two
[  632.52-  634.48] FEE016: monus two and a seven is four
[  637.04-  637.64] FEE013: i would agree
[  638.70-  646.76] MEE014: yeah i would yeah i would probably put it two yeah two or three no three three
[  638.80-  639.62] FEE016: a two six
[  639.48-  639.80] FEE013: ok
[  640.16-  640.52] MEO015: ok
[  644.98-  645.48] FEE016: it is a three
[  646.80-  647.44] FEE016: ok
[  649.50-  650.06] FEE013: i would say a two
[  650.28-  650.70] FEE016: two
[  653.18-  655.22] MEO015: i would say four ok
[  654.10-  660.00] FEE016: a four ok icing those up we have got six and a five eleven divided by four
[  660.00-  666.18] FEE016: is what do you want to think what chance is that one do you want to think what chance
[  662.78-  663.76] MEE014: yeah
[  663.24-  663.78] MEO015: one to three
[  667.56-  668.16] MEO015: i think it
[  668.40-  669.52] MEE014: yeah yeah
[  669.38-  669.76] FEE016: ok
[  671.92-  679.44] FEE016: two point seven five there we go ok criteria being criterion being technologically innovative
[  680.80-  683.70] FEE016: i would give that a three
[  686.40-  687.36] MEE014: i would give it a one
[  687.76-  690.00] FEE016: ok not that you are biased
[  690.00-  692.92] FEE016: the design
[  690.04-  691.76] MEE014: no no not at all
[  696.02-  696.60] FEE013: a two
[  698.92-  704.28] MEO015: oh sorry man i got it wrong the first one rating i am sorry can you just make it two
[  705.32-  708.64] FEE016: the average you want your rating to be a two
[  705.44-  707.56] MEO015: the first yeah i just thought it that the
[  708.98-  709.72] MEO015: a
[  710.36-  712.04] FEE016: is that what you are saying
[  711.16-  712.12] MEO015: yep i just got it
[  714.96-  717.96] FEE016: so i will work out the average for that again again it is a very slightly altered
[  720.00-  721.76] FEE016: i am just waiting for you to
[  720.68-  721.32] MEO015: two point four
[  721.16-  722.86] FEE013: it is just two point five for that one
[  723.04-  724.20] FEE016: two point five ok
[  723.10-  723.60] MEE014: yeah
[  727.56-  730.10] FEE016: moving the blind desk please that is the fifth
[  728.78-  730.84] MEO015: and here is a good proof sevens four sevens
[  731.00-  734.04] FEE016: i thought you are waiting for this one a power two ok
[  732.46-  732.68] MEO015: two
[  735.80-  739.92] FEE016: so that is eight so that means it is out of two nice and simple yeah
[  741.54-  744.84] FEE016: ok ease of use easy to use
[  746.00-  749.46] FEE016: based on what you have said there i would say one true
[  753.08-  753.42] MEE014: two
[  753.92-  754.52] FEE016: two
[  758.52-  761.58] FEE013: i would say a two i would say a two
[  760.22-  761.12] FEE016: a two ok
[  763.62-  764.08] MEO015: two
[  764.14-  764.56] FEE016: two
[  766.42-  780.00] FEE016: i should have said a two to make little footage but i should not we will just put almost two because we will get too silly decimal places ok or we or if we want to really bring it down we can do this and
[  772.44-  775.62] FEE013: one point seventy five ok
[  774.16-  774.48] MEE014: yeah
[  780.00-  793.00] FEE016: then we are looking at it incorporates current fashion trends and that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colors
[  785.52-  785.84] MEE014: right
[  793.56-  793.84] MEE014: yeah
[  794.46-  803.88] FEE016: right so i am just thinking before i give it my writing you are limited in the use of materials for your prototype here is this actually going to be the colors that you do
[  801.20-  802.28] MEE014: yeah that is
[  803.40-  810.00] MEE014: no no the the base color was white or or like or l sort of a light
[  806.38-  808.60] MEO015: white with the plastic or pure
[  810.00-  820.44] MEE014: blue but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any basically any one of the number of colors that looks full sort of customary
[  810.68-  810.96] FEE016: right
[  815.52-  816.04] MEO015: yeah
[  818.60-  825.84] FEE016: so we could use any stronger fruit and better colors and that is what we are intending to do ok and the spongy feel is no problem with that
[  821.44-  821.80] MEO015: right
[  821.54-  824.72] MEE014: yeah and
[  822.52-  822.86] FEE013: yeah
[  822.96-  823.20] MEO015: yeah
[  825.88-  834.92] MEE014: no no cause if that is that is the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it but otherwise it is just sort of hard plastic
[  826.00-  827.52] MEO015: yeah because you would get
[  830.08-  831.14] MEO015: because you are going to work it
[  832.08-  832.68] FEE016: ok
[  835.00-  836.84] FEE016: in that case it has got to be a one for me
[  838.00-  839.50] MEE014: yeah i will give it a one as well
[  839.38-  839.96] FEE016: yeah
[  840.00-  841.40] FEE016: very good if they can
[  840.48-  840.80] FEE013: yeah
[  843.30-  843.80] MEO015: well
[  844.68-  852.94] FEE016: that part was nice anyway ok moving on to does the design minimize a better strain injury
[  845.88-  846.72] MEE014: yeah
[  854.98-  860.08] FEE016: i do not think we have really touched on that a lot we we have discussed it we have not really come up with anything without
[  855.02-  855.72] MEE014: yeah
[  856.56-  857.08] MEE014: yeah
[  861.56-  870.00] FEE016: we felt could feasibly reduce that we have talked about pointers but the very use of our valve control if you are someone who does that thing for sitting there and you are very keen like if you did how do you minimize
[  867.46-  868.04] MEE014: yeah
[  870.00-  871.78] FEE016: myself that is just not about it
[  871.36-  879.56] FEE013: well the type of button that we are going to use in the bottom half the material minimizes r s i it is meant to
[  875.92-  876.62] MEE014: meant to
[  876.06-  876.40] FEE016: right
[  881.92-  892.32] FEE013: maybe because it is slightly with the size that we have got it is quite small but with the amount of stuff we are putting on it is not that much so maybe because there is more space it is not kind of moving around kinda
[  893.12-  899.60] FEE013: hit accurately the buttons in between it is quite obvious just big buttons
[  893.12-  893.54] FEE016: right
[  895.20-  895.62] FEE016: right
[  898.06-  900.00] FEE016: right i think the
[  900.00-  902.94] FEE016: think i am going to have to be neutral on that we give it up for a
[  902.32-  902.86] MEE014: yeah
[  905.60-  909.56] MEE014: yeah i would i would f i would go through five actually
[  908.14-  909.58] FEE016: five there we go
[  911.52-  911.88] FEE013: four
[  911.94-  915.04] FEE016: five
[  913.16-  913.62] MEO015: four
[  917.62-  922.02] FEE016: twenty one twenty one so that is four upon two five
[  925.60-  930.00] FEE016: and finally last but not least easy to locate so we talked about
[  930.00-  935.60] FEE016: about voice recognition we talked about a beeper and we really in this time just come to any display of the channel
[  932.80-  939.32] MEE014: yeah yeah it was it was a a voice voice recognition yeah
[  936.00-  937.54] MEO015: voice recognition
[  937.32-  944.32] FEE016: that was the armhole thing yeah and we are happy with the costs and we are not that is going to work as well cost wise
[  942.76-  945.36] MEE014: yeah yeah that yeah that is feasible
[  945.46-  950.28] FEE016: that sounds good then i would go for i think we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on t v
[  951.26-  953.44] MEE014: and i think it would
[  952.16-  955.36] FEE016: so if someone is in the other room or t v is in different rooms and
[  956.02-  960.00] MEE014: i think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand
[  958.22-  959.02] FEE013: a standard
[  960.00-  964.48] MEE014: and it it would be quite loud so it would be s yeah
[  961.48-  962.08] FEE013: it would be
[  961.68-  964.48] FEE016: ok built into a feature
[  963.84-  968.44] FEE013: and if you did not hear it in the room you were standing in and you realized it was not in that room it would go into another room
[  967.32-  967.76] FEE016: yeah
[  968.08-  968.28] MEE014: right
[  969.00-  971.56] FEE016: logical that is a one for me
[  972.22-  973.08] MEE014: yeah one
[  972.80-  975.64] FEE016: one and one
[  973.72-  973.96] FEE013: one
[  977.66-  982.04] MEE014: i do realize that the amount of people are fairly biased because it is not
[  983.12-  990.00] FEE016: so how do we feel about this we have got our we have got the highest rating of meeting specifications
[  990.00- 1019.56] FEE016: is definitely true for two of the six criteria there that is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate the lowest writing we have got which is really not it is not terribly low it is it is close around neutral is for the minimization of repetitive strain injury do we feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it or do we have to make further modifications
[ 1021.40- 1022.18] FEE013: i do not think so
[ 1022.90- 1026.04] MEE014: well i think yeah i think yeah
[ 1023.44- 1024.40] FEE016: yeah to go ahead
[ 1024.30- 1026.28] FEE013: i think me yeah i take percent
[ 1025.62- 1032.00] FEE016: yeah i think for most of those ratings it is high enough that the upper end of the scale goes to go ahead because i really doubt
[ 1033.08- 1039.46] FEE016: on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we could actually do much more in it with that
[ 1037.84- 1040.28] FEE013: too much apart from having a huge big
[ 1039.24- 1039.86] MEE014: yeah
[ 1040.36- 1048.16] FEE016: i know ok well i hope that is clear to the team is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before i
[ 1049.28- 1049.64] FEE016: thought up
[ 1050.24- 1050.80] FEE013: do not think so
[ 1050.44- 1050.72] MEE014: yeah
[ 1050.90- 1055.90] FEE016: good i will just leave it there for a moment
[ 1054.70- 1055.66] FEE013: ok thank you
[ 1064.68- 1070.60] FEE013: ok i have got finance here now i am going to plug this in so you can all see it if that is ok
[ 1064.68- 1065.24] MEO015: ok
[ 1072.24- 1072.92] FEE016: yes
[ 1078.78- 1080.00] MEO015: do you want to read a button like that
[ 1096.54- 1097.68] MEO015: that is all this
[ 1098.28- 1098.80] FEE013: yes
[ 1108.88- 1109.32] FEE013: right
[ 1110.38- 1111.04] MEO015: oh
[ 1112.62- 1113.74] FEE013: now i presume
[ 1115.56- 1116.72] FEE013: that the screen will go by
[ 1117.92- 1119.60] FEE013: that
[ 1126.00- 1134.86] FEE013: ok we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final bite so are we still on for kinetic
[ 1135.10- 1135.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 1135.44- 1135.70] FEE016: yeah
[ 1136.16- 1140.00] FEE013: ok see it would have been handy to have this at the beginning
[ 1140.00- 1142.18] FEE013: it might have influenced our choice
[ 1145.10- 1147.88] FEE013: right what is happening with the electronics
[ 1148.36- 1151.84] MEE014: it was regular chip on print and
[ 1150.00- 1150.80] MEO015: chip on print
[ 1157.94- 1158.88] FEE013: the
[ 1158.10- 1159.58] MEE014: oh no no no the
[ 1161.34- 1166.78] MEE014: yeah it is you you put in three for the number of kinetic cells there should just be one
[ 1168.02- 1169.88] MEE014: in the top it is the number of
[ 1170.00- 1171.20] FEE013: oh right ok
[ 1170.00- 1171.12] MEE014: yeah
[ 1172.40- 1172.96] FEE013: thanks
[ 1174.66- 1179.26] MEE014: yeah and yeah just no one rig
[ 1175.20- 1176.28] FEE013: so would there be two
[ 1179.72- 1180.28] FEE013: one chip
[ 1180.64- 1183.66] MEE014: yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample screen
[ 1183.44- 1183.92] MEO015: ok
[ 1183.80- 1184.36] FEE013: ok
[ 1187.64- 1188.14] MEO015: yeah
[ 1188.18- 1191.46] MEE014: and they are double card no
[ 1190.92- 1192.08] MEO015: single hook
[ 1191.30- 1192.12] FEE013: one double curve
[ 1192.92- 1194.44] MEE014: two cause it is two easier
[ 1193.72- 1194.32] MEO015: two close yeah
[ 1194.80- 1197.68] FEE016: but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can fit
[ 1197.30- 1198.68] FEE013: so what is a single curve then
[ 1198.50- 1200.00] MEE014: yeah i would say i would say it was
[ 1199.32- 1199.96] FEE016: just be a flat bottom
[ 1200.00- 1202.84] FEE016: button with one curve at the bottom or with like a double curve
[ 1200.00- 1202.52] MEE014: yeah i think i think it is
[ 1202.88- 1204.32] FEE013: so just one double
[ 1203.00- 1203.68] MEO015: one and rubber
[ 1204.64- 1205.74] MEE014: one double curved
[ 1205.48- 1207.54] FEE013: yeah
[ 1206.92- 1211.72] MEE014: and what no cause one yeah one is double curved and then the other one is
[ 1207.72- 1208.64] MEO015: it is one and rubber
[ 1210.64- 1214.24] FEE016: the other curves it the size but it is slightly flattened at the bottom so it does not roll over
[ 1213.84- 1214.20] FEE013: yeah
[ 1216.96- 1220.36] FEE013: we have got plastic and rubber have not we
[ 1217.76- 1218.46] MEE014: plastic
[ 1220.58- 1220.80] MEE014: yeah
[ 1221.04- 1224.44] MEO015: yeah plastic one and maybe about point five
[ 1223.18- 1224.12] MEE014: and a special color
[ 1227.56- 1230.00] MEO015: no i think rubber since it is being used just as a casing we
[ 1230.00- 1231.00] MEO015: can put point five
[ 1232.32- 1233.04] MEE014: yeah
[ 1232.90- 1233.28] FEE013: do you think
[ 1233.48- 1234.40] MEO015: yeah because there are
[ 1235.48- 1238.94] MEO015: i think it allows point five here you can use that
[ 1239.12- 1239.80] MEE014: yeah
[ 1239.32- 1239.72] FEE013: ok
[ 1240.68- 1242.48] FEE016: what does it mean if you put point five here
[ 1242.52- 1245.36] MEO015: means we are not using a lot of rubber actually we are just use
[ 1244.84- 1246.42] FEE013: it would be like saying we are using
[ 1246.80- 1249.56] MEO015: a very low point of rubber compared to plastic
[ 1250.74- 1252.62] FEE013: see it says case material
[ 1253.86- 1260.00] FEE013: so we are not actually using plastic in a case are we it is including it is including
[ 1257.14- 1259.32] MEE014: no no that is it is that is an extra
[ 1259.48- 1260.00] FEE016: right
[ 1260.00- 1260.92] FEE016: ok
[ 1260.44- 1266.80] MEE014: so that should not that should not be actually on there because that is not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get
[ 1267.28- 1276.76] FEE016: but it is going to be part of the total cost and there is nowhere else we can we can put that in is not there there is nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere though
[ 1278.40- 1281.24] FEE013: ok we will just put it in as we will put it in as half
[ 1281.24- 1281.48] FEE016: ok
[ 1283.56- 1286.36] FEE013: or sh we should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway
[ 1286.34- 1287.64] MEE014: yeah ok
[ 1290.00- 1293.94] FEE013: and then you have to use ok special color do we need that
[ 1294.34- 1299.36] FEE016: we might do i figure for some of them were exotic commercials and such like colors
[ 1296.44- 1297.36] FEE013: yeah ok
[ 1300.48- 1301.52] FEE013: interface
[ 1302.12- 1302.72] MEO015: push button
[ 1304.20- 1308.24] MEE014: yeah the push buttons one and l c display one
[ 1305.00- 1305.32] MEO015: yeah
[ 1309.64- 1310.08] MEO015: one
[ 1311.34- 1311.98] MEE014: and buttons
[ 1311.80- 1312.08] FEE013: button
[ 1320.00- 1349.98] FEE013: thank you
[ 1320.00- 1349.98] FEE016: thank you
[ 1320.00- 1349.98] MEE014: thank you
[ 1320.00- 1349.98] MEO015: thank you
[ 1370.72- 1370.88] FEE016: is
[ 1371.92- 1375.94] MEO015: i think we could change the battery also instead of going for how about going for a standard battery
[ 1377.36- 1380.00] FEE016: is that not me down if you click off that square now
[ 1380.00- 1383.82] FEE016: is it not made any difference because it was brought it slightly
[ 1382.04- 1383.12] MEE014: well
[ 1382.36- 1386.72] FEE013: is that not going up oh no it is seven five it is change not a lot
[ 1386.26- 1391.26] FEE016: so it is it is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is not going to make a difference
[ 1390.02- 1390.32] MEE014: yeah
[ 1391.60- 1392.64] MEO015: and go flat
[ 1395.62- 1398.60] FEE016: well that has not made any difference has it it has gone up again
[ 1397.52- 1398.48] MEE014: no well i
[ 1397.88- 1399.60] MEO015: no it is just right as well
[ 1398.64- 1400.56] FEE013: oh it is not calculated yet
[ 1399.38- 1402.08] MEE014: i know you have got to click off the calculator again
[ 1400.04- 1400.28] FEE016: yeah
[ 1402.80- 1403.56] FEE013: ok there we go
[ 1403.88- 1405.08] FEE016: slaught it down slightly
[ 1405.18- 1410.00] MEE014: it might yeah you might you might be assuming that that is in
[ 1405.34- 1406.40] FEE013: it is not a lot there
[ 1410.00- 1420.12] MEE014: euros it could be in dollars and then we would be fine because the exchange rate would make it a better way
[ 1416.36- 1417.68] FEE016: is there anything on the main
[ 1416.42- 1419.48] FEE013: we have not been dealing we have not been dealing with dollars though i think
[ 1416.90- 1417.60] MEO015: i do not
[ 1418.60- 1418.84] FEE016: yeah
[ 1419.88- 1421.14] MEO015: i think it is a new one
[ 1421.12- 1424.00] FEE013: ok so the highest we have got is the electronics here
[ 1427.48- 1428.80] FEE016: if we tried
[ 1427.94- 1429.44] FEE013: and the interface
[ 1429.88- 1436.44] FEE016: if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference
[ 1433.72- 1435.12] MEO015: move away to integrate
[ 1436.48- 1440.00] MEE014: yeah the standard it would make one difference
[ 1436.80- 1437.00] MEO015: yeah
[ 1440.00- 1443.20] MEE014: the biggest round would be taking away if you took away
[ 1444.22- 1452.08] MEO015: what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery it is internal nobody looks into the battery but shape and color that is something we should check
[ 1445.44- 1445.80] MEE014: if you
[ 1448.56- 1448.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 1450.28- 1455.08] FEE016: and people are used to buying vouchers they are not going to say not getting this they are got to buy voucher for a remote control
[ 1451.00- 1457.18] MEE014: if if you take away the voice i i do not i do not like to say it but if you take away the voice recognition then you have got it
[ 1458.66- 1460.22] MEO015: where is that special for
[ 1461.32- 1463.04] MEO015: i know
[ 1461.66- 1463.38] FEE016: do we see what difference it makes
[ 1462.96- 1463.48] FEE013: where is the
[ 1463.48- 1470.00] MEE014: yeah yeah no cause it is sample s sensor sample speaker you took away that
[ 1464.44- 1465.68] FEE013: where is the voice recognition
[ 1464.50- 1464.70] FEE016: yeah
[ 1468.64- 1469.56] FEE013: right ok
[ 1470.00- 1472.06] MEE014: that will make it twelve point three five
[ 1472.12- 1476.40] FEE013: well the kinetic is three if we change it to the battery it is that is minus three
[ 1475.40- 1480.16] MEE014: but y n yeah but you minus three plus two
[ 1480.24- 1482.40] FEE013: oh right keeps things hearing
[ 1489.16- 1500.00] FEE013: we can do it some other way we can do it does not have to be voice recognition we could do the voice recognition for you know business class or something you know like a upgraded version
[ 1497.72- 1498.00] FEE016: yeah
[ 1499.76- 1500.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 1500.00- 1502.18] FEE013: you could choose to have them or not
[ 1500.00- 1500.28] FEE016: sure
[ 1500.00- 1511.32] MEE014: but they but i mean in i do not see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product
[ 1511.80- 1514.60] FEE016: but we are still working to head off
[ 1513.26- 1516.60] FEE013: so should we just change the design specification then
[ 1515.68- 1530.00] FEE016: if we put in our recommendations but if we are if we are working to head office specifications as this is what this project team is working for we can put in our recommendations for what we have we have found and what we the consensus that we have come to the result of the meetings but we need to work to that specification to start with
[ 1516.96- 1517.52] MEO015: make it possible
[ 1517.90- 1518.32] FEE013: yes
[ 1522.08- 1522.46] MEE014: yeah
[ 1526.76- 1527.14] FEE013: ok
[ 1526.84- 1528.56] MEE014: we have we can
[ 1530.00- 1544.88] FEE016: and and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate as a you know in a first instance as you say we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class companies
[ 1530.04- 1531.08] MEE014: yeah we can say
[ 1530.08- 1530.52] FEE013: yeah
[ 1544.92- 1546.04] FEE013: ok we can
[ 1547.12- 1547.72] MEE014: yeah unless
[ 1547.48- 1560.00] FEE013: make the price fit and then say if we would had our budget we would have had this because it also sets apart from the ground they like their gadgets they like something that is completely different
[ 1549.96- 1551.72] MEE014: and then say we recommend
[ 1552.08- 1552.46] FEE016: yeah
[ 1553.36- 1553.60] MEE014: yeah
[ 1553.38- 1553.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 1555.06- 1558.00] FEE016: cause we have done all the background work to go for that if they want to
[ 1559.56- 1559.82] MEE014: yeah
[ 1560.00- 1564.64] FEE013: it is it is c some completely different associated with your company right ok so
[ 1560.28- 1560.84] FEE016: right
[ 1565.40- 1567.68] FEE016: so if we take voice recognition out
[ 1567.94- 1576.88] MEE014: down the twelve point three five five is it twelve point fifty was it twelve point fifty
[ 1572.24- 1573.50] MEO015: yeah very close to the budget
[ 1572.82- 1573.20] FEE016: right
[ 1575.00- 1575.88] MEO015: twelve five
[ 1575.04- 1579.08] FEE013: it is two point five no it is twelve point two five
[ 1579.88- 1582.60] FEE016: are you sure sorry not meaning to doubt your word then
[ 1581.90- 1584.82] FEE013: yeah well two twelve point two five times two is
[ 1586.28- 1589.64] FEE016: right oh i think we should really quibble about ten p
[ 1586.68- 1588.16] FEE013: twenty five is not it
[ 1588.00- 1589.32] MEO015: it is quite fun maybe
[ 1591.44- 1595.66] FEE016: and quite smaller than one of your row which is less than ten i think
[ 1601.50- 1606.36] MEO015: i do not know but it said fifty percent is the cost of the price of the price
[ 1604.82- 1608.68] FEE013: i think the agenda one was where the price was is not it no
[ 1612.96- 1613.88] MEO015: i think that is the first one
[ 1614.52- 1615.34] FEE016: that is today
[ 1619.40- 1620.00] FEE016: ok come on
[ 1620.00- 1620.68] FEE016: i see
[ 1622.62- 1623.38] FEE013: twelve point five
[ 1623.70- 1628.74] FEE016: so we are ok so we are ok
[ 1624.28- 1625.12] MEE014: oh
[ 1624.72- 1626.10] MEO015: right
[ 1626.44- 1627.20] FEE013: y old young people
[ 1630.56- 1632.16] MEE014: ok
[ 1630.88- 1637.26] FEE013: so is that got us covered for the electronics then we do not need something else to take that place ok
[ 1634.52- 1634.80] MEE014: yep
[ 1636.26- 1642.24] MEE014: no cause that that was just a bolt on x ray you could just take that out
[ 1643.76- 1645.36] MEE014: and it will be fine
[ 1645.08- 1645.48] FEE013: ok
[ 1653.16- 1653.76] MEO015: seems fine
[ 1655.04- 1655.98] MEE014: yeah i think
[ 1655.80- 1657.92] MEO015: exa voice recognition everything is
[ 1657.32- 1659.20] FEE013: right i have done that
[ 1662.04- 1665.60] FEE013: ok product evaluation
[ 1666.92- 1675.74] FEE013: we have done room for creativity have not we because we have got decisions that we would have made that we were not did not feel able to make
[ 1669.24- 1669.56] MEE014: yeah
[ 1669.66- 1669.96] MEO015: that is right
[ 1677.48- 1680.00] FEE013: i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork
[ 1683.68- 1685.24] MEE014: yes
[ 1684.26- 1684.48] MEO015: yep
[ 1685.36- 1687.36] FEE013: in the sense that
[ 1689.16- 1698.06] FEE013: did you feel like a team or did you feel like a better set or ton
[ 1695.04- 1696.24] MEE014: i would say as a team
[ 1696.56- 1710.00] FEE016: i thought we had our separate time there was so much interaction so much that we needed to and solve for each other and i have certainly felt heard listened to and that in relevant areas we have been able to you know give and take and i just
[ 1697.04- 1698.20] MEO015: i think we were nice
[ 1698.48- 1698.84] MEE014: yeah
[ 1701.16- 1703.08] MEE014: find out from each other yeah
[ 1710.00- 1712.38] FEE016: just our remote or necessary
[ 1711.30- 1711.60] MEE014: yeah
[ 1713.32- 1725.56] MEO015: yeah i think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody it is not like people trying to cut to each other it is more of a through cohesive teamwork we came to a very pretty creative design yeah
[ 1726.72- 1727.52] MEO015: yeah and
[ 1728.92- 1731.36] MEO015: yeah i think and sarah you coordinated the work very well
[ 1731.84- 1734.46] FEE013: thank you how did you find it
[ 1734.64- 1740.00] MEE014: yeah no i thought it it went really well and i yeah i i
[ 1740.00- 1768.00] MEE014: feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seemed to have been sorted out though we did not quite make the voice recognition in there but that is that is good i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually for if if we had seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out i think maybe it would have come out a little different but yeah
[ 1753.18- 1753.64] FEE013: yeah
[ 1766.96- 1770.00] FEE013: yeah i like the fact that
[ 1770.00- 1788.90] FEE013: we could say an idea and it would be suggested that there was not the best idea but no one felt like shot down you know it did not matter saying what you thought because if it was not something that was that relevant then it did not matter cause it was just another idea in the field i like that
[ 1778.02- 1778.36] MEE014: yeah
[ 1778.40- 1778.80] MEO015: yeah
[ 1786.58- 1786.94] MEE014: yeah
[ 1787.34- 1787.64] FEE016: yeah
[ 1790.08- 1794.86] FEE013: teamwork well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model
[ 1795.18- 1796.00] MEE014: yeah yeah
[ 1795.96- 1799.16] MEO015: i think that was the best part of the
[ 1800.00- 1805.96] FEE013: i am still not caught up but that is nothing to do with the teamwork at all
[ 1806.76- 1814.20] FEE016: maybe we should think of branching out into children is toys and fake mobile phones if the thing if they are c s
[ 1810.00- 1810.64] FEE013: maybe
[ 1813.16- 1813.40] MEO015: f
[ 1814.44- 1821.32] FEE013: no that was quite fun means whiteboard digital pens et cetera what does that mean anything i did not
[ 1820.60- 1825.50] FEE016: how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information and
[ 1821.28- 1823.32] MEE014: discuss which ones yeah
[ 1825.80- 1826.10] MEE014: yeah
[ 1826.90- 1828.72] FEE016: could it have been better was it adequate
[ 1829.64- 1829.96] MEE014: yeah
[ 1830.00- 1835.04] MEE014: think i think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually
[ 1835.62- 1836.56] FEE013: had time to kind of
[ 1837.06- 1841.84] MEE014: had had more time and if we had been separated more
[ 1841.50- 1849.84] FEE013: yeah cause we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that rather than having to email it you know but it was nice having it there
[ 1843.24- 1843.52] MEE014: yeah
[ 1845.84- 1846.16] MEE014: yeah
[ 1847.38- 1847.86] MEE014: yeah
[ 1851.04- 1853.50] FEE013: like the whole picture of the thing
[ 1854.16- 1860.00] MEO015: yeah i do not like moving around the room i think it is good like to
[ 1860.00- 1862.64] MEO015: we spend times individually
[ 1894.74- 1897.44] MEO015: anyone thought of a remote control with a flip top
[ 1899.96- 1902.40] FEE013: yeah i think it is the ideas in general yeah
[ 1900.84- 1909.22] FEE016: it is borrowing from other areas it is you know bringing things from other areas in it so it is i mean nothing is anew but it is applying it to a d in a different area
[ 1902.00- 1902.30] MEE014: yeah
[ 1907.00- 1907.40] FEE013: yeah
[ 1909.26- 1910.18] MEE014: vegetables
[ 1911.32- 1912.04] MEO015: that is my answer
[ 1912.24- 1912.70] MEE014: yeah
[ 1915.76- 1918.88] FEE013: yeah no well they have to come from somewhere do not they
[ 1916.64- 1917.08] MEO015: yeah it is
[ 1918.32- 1919.44] FEE016: absolutely yeah
[ 1920.04- 1920.72] MEO015: but it does not
[ 1920.20- 1942.16] FEE013: and as sh as we sorry go on as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls remote controls no one is thought about it particularly i mean they are slightly different so someone has been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else is cause this is something we should think about but obviously no one is put any great deal of thought into it
[ 1921.74- 1922.52] MEO015: yeah sorry go on
[ 1930.56- 1930.94] MEE014: no
[ 1940.12- 1950.00] MEE014: yeah i do not i do not think the the companies are really concerned they are just like we have got a d v d player does anyone remember the remote control can not you get
[ 1950.00- 1962.76] MEE014: one that we used for the last one yeah just jazz it up a bit they they do not really think about it because normally the remote control is not the product which they are trying to ship they are trying to ship the d v d player the video player the t v
[ 1952.42- 1952.62] FEE016: yeah
[ 1954.50- 1955.26] FEE016: yeah
[ 1960.08- 1962.02] FEE016: yeah the focus is not onto that
[ 1961.76- 1980.00] FEE013: but then when it everything is really smart and you have just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it does not go i mean if you could have something that is a proper funky thing a funky item that is individual individual to you i mean they could even go into you
[ 1964.64- 1964.92] MEE014: yeah
[ 1967.12- 1967.44] MEE014: yeah
[ 1970.04- 1970.64] MEE014: yeah
[ 1972.82- 1973.20] MEE014: yeah
[ 1980.00- 1995.56] FEE013: go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic you would pay you would pay a lot extra because it is individually being a plastic was being made for you but people could have have anything that they wanted
[ 1984.68- 1985.00] MEE014: yeah
[ 1991.38- 1991.90] MEE014: yeah
[ 1996.80- 2010.00] MEO015: surprisingly is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like every month you see a new launch or something like that and new f television products coming up but nobody giving a
[ 1997.12- 1997.92] FEE013: pricific work
[ 2005.70- 2006.06] MEE014: yeah
[ 2010.00- 2012.88] MEO015: much idea to this like salvaging everything
[ 2011.08- 2039.60] FEE016: i think it is really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is is obvious and visible we see it in mobile phones a lot and that that is where we have borrowed a lot of ide ideas from there are innovations in that that people do not really want i see people wanting a model of the phone they are really happy with and they can not get it anymore and it is innovation for innovation is sake and i think it is wonderful that our company is so r and d based
[ 2015.68- 2015.96] MEO015: yeah
[ 2031.16- 2031.84] FEE013: yes
[ 2031.36- 2031.78] MEE014: yeah
[ 2034.60- 2035.08] FEE013: yeah
[ 2040.00- 2046.00] FEE013: it is innovation for money is sake that that people have to keep on yeah
[ 2043.12- 2048.92] FEE016: yeah that people but forcing it on to people things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really want
[ 2048.06- 2056.44] FEE013: and you can get you have got your handset that works fine but you can not get the battery anymore for that type of phone because the phones have moved on things like that yes
[ 2054.56- 2056.62] FEE016: oh there is not a cover to fit it or whatever yeah
[ 2057.78- 2059.54] FEE013: spendless
[ 2062.24- 2063.48] FEE013: in closing
[ 2064.60- 2070.00] FEE013: there we go our costs are below budget with
[ 2070.00- 2077.52] FEE013: recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i do not know what do you think do you think that is takes into account
[ 2079.96- 2080.72] FEE013: overhead is
[ 2081.56- 2089.84] FEE013: like us being well paid kind of thing and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
[ 2085.80- 2086.12] MEE014: yeah
[ 2089.60- 2092.96] FEE016: i think it was just the produ just the production cost of the fire
[ 2091.18- 2093.28] MEE014: i think that is just the physical
[ 2093.12- 2100.00] FEE013: so it looks well it looks like it is going to be fifty percent profit you have still got all of the overheads to come out of that so
[ 2096.66- 2096.96] MEE014: yeah
[ 2097.24- 2097.72] FEE016: yeah
[ 2100.00- 2108.48] FEE013: so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that it sold at people that i think but you were saying that that is quite
[ 2100.00- 2100.24] MEE014: yeah
[ 2105.60- 2107.08] MEO015: maybe if people
[ 2105.88- 2110.64] MEE014: yeah that is good yeah i do not do not market any of those
[ 2108.56- 2122.44] FEE016: i think in the remit that we were given it was very specific i think we have done what we are required to do and i think there will have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things i do not think that is something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for
[ 2112.64- 2113.10] FEE013: yeah
[ 2120.60- 2120.88] FEE013: yeah
[ 2120.84- 2121.24] MEE014: no

[   60.00-   60.84] FIE088: ourselves
[   61.54-   62.56] FIO089: yeah that is a great thing
[   62.00-   67.28] FIE088: and his name and what your function is so maybe we will start with you
[   66.64-   80.84] FIO087: ok yeah my name is franz ena and i am an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface and my role is to design a television remote control
[   81.04-   82.06] FIE088: ok
[   83.40-   86.94] FIO089: and i am a marketing person i want to figure out how to sell them
[   87.48-   88.60] FIE088: and your name is
[   88.82-   89.68] FIO089: my name is eileen
[   90.20-   90.52] FIE088: ok
[   91.32-  107.40] FIO084: yeah i am janvi i am my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design
[  107.88-  118.16] FIE088: very good and as you already know i am betsy i am the project manager for today so why do not we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do
[  118.76-  119.04] FIO089: ok
[  122.40-  132.40] FIE088: here is the opening acquaintance tool training well the tools i think we already i guess the tool is really our the computer as far as i can see
[  132.88-  146.76] FIE088: we get inst each of us will get instructions and we will take it from there project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much i do not think we have any great discussion at this point
[  150.00-  162.32] FIE088: what this thing should be this thing we are going to design is a new remote control should be original trendy and of course user friendly
[  165.20-  167.00] FIE088: so maybe i will make some notes of that
[  188.06-  188.34] FIO089: ok
[  195.04-  195.28] FIE088: ok
[  196.38-  202.40] FIE088: alright here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
[  203.78-  210.00] FIE088: that is it is going to be individual work and then at the meeting we will discuss what
[  210.00-  218.20] FIE088: we have come up with the same goes for the s conceptual design there will be individual work and then discussion afterwards
[  219.44-  222.12] FIE088: detailed design same thing basically
[  220.46-  221.48] FIO089: ok so
[  222.76-  226.44] FIO089: three different types of design that we are going to be concerned with as well
[  236.12-  238.38] FIO089: factual conception
[  241.00-  242.50] FIO089: right
[  243.94-  245.46] FIE088: ok i will use this
[  248.32-  251.04] FIO089: maybe we should redesign it
[  251.80-  252.70] FIE088: yes
[  252.78-  254.70] FIO089: after we finish the remote control we will get to that
[  255.24-  257.74] FIE088: yeah ok alright
[  260.02-  270.00] FIE088: then tool training try out the whiteboard person control their favorite animal does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works so that in case we have
[  270.00-  272.52] FIE088: during the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
[  274.68-  275.96] FIE088: you want to go eileen and
[  276.24-  278.88] FIO089: ok i will see what i can do see if i
[  277.60-  279.86] FIE088: whether you without hanging yourself
[  280.08-  285.52] FIO089: see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something
[  288.10-  291.16] FIE088: and remember you have to press so it works
[  290.06-  297.76] FIO089: so that it will not work i think oh to resolve kitty cat
[  308.92-  310.64] FIE088: it is a fat cat
[  311.20-  318.44] FIO089: i am a very fat cat and it likes to sit like that ok
[  317.64-  318.04] FIE088: ok
[  320.52-  327.50] FIE088: and your front scene right would you like like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea
[  322.24-  325.08] FIO087: yes i am fascinated yes for sure
[  328.76-  330.00] FIO089: am i supposed to wear a box
[  329.04-  329.28] FIE088: it
[  330.00-  332.82] FIO089: i am on the right ok
[  330.22-  331.52] FIE088: no no no that is ok
[  331.58-  333.36] FIO087: yeah ok
[  333.56-  335.48] FIE088: i do not know we will get to that later
[  336.02-  336.44] FIO089: ok
[  337.48-  339.64] FIO087: get your edge
[  347.66-  348.32] FIO084: sleep
[  348.00-  349.78] FIO087: i do you need to draw sleek
[  355.86-  358.96] FIO087: i do you need to draw sleek
[  357.32-  358.06] FIO089: ok
[  360.00-  360.44] FIE088: ok
[  360.00-  364.82] FIO089: i hope the kitty cat is hungry cause it all expects
[  367.24-  375.94] FIE088: here is a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
[  377.24-  386.08] FIE088: profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
[  386.52-  387.02] FIO089: ok
[  387.40-  390.00] FIE088: and the production cost should not exceed
[  390.00-  393.64] FIE088: it hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
[  395.24-  398.52] FIO089: ok that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged
[  400.24-  400.92] FIO089: with it
[  402.86-  406.48] FIO089: and as fifty
[  403.80-  412.68] FIE088: so these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design through materials cost et cetera
[  419.16-  420.00] FIE088: now
[  420.00-  427.58] FIE088: the discussion i guess is does any one of you have experience with remote control
[  420.14-  420.46] FIO089: s
[  428.68-  431.54] FIO084: yeah of course as a remote control yeah
[  428.96-  435.00] FIE088: ex i guess we we use em we use em right every day and
[  429.72-  430.10] FIO087: yes
[  436.56-  449.24] FIE088: now having used in a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you did not like with it things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas
[  450.36-  460.58] FIE088: be like it would be smaller bigger have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that
[  451.06-  451.36] FIO084: yeah
[  453.94-  454.36] FIO087: yeah i
[  459.86-  461.80] FIO084: yeah
[  461.46-  480.00] FIO087: yes i i feel that all the remote should be very compact like those which we get here nowadays it is very long and and it should have multi purpose like the remote control which we use for t v it shu it should be used f for some other purpose also like
[  465.14-  466.44] FIE088: small right
[  480.00-  486.72] FIO087: controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system
[  481.36-  482.62] FIE088: yeah
[  481.70-  484.34] FIO084: oh d oh
[  486.72-  495.26] FIE088: so it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically
[  488.48-  489.46] FIO087: yes exa
[  489.96-  490.40] FIO087: yes
[  492.56-  492.92] FIO087: yes
[  493.30-  495.52] FIO084: yeah yeah
[  494.72-  495.68] FIO087: yeah exactly
[  497.24-  502.28] FIO089: but twelve fifty euros per
[  502.76-  503.46] FIE088: well
[  503.78-  506.76] FIO089: well you know so if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that
[  506.18-  506.80] FIO084: yeah
[  508.16-  510.00] FIO089: we certainly can try to i agree
[  510.00-  513.56] FIO089: with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
[  513.12-  521.08] FIE088: it should be something new it should pus it sh it should do something different than than just what we have now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
[  517.36-  517.76] FIO089: that is right
[  517.80-  518.74] FIO084: yeah
[  518.12-  518.50] FIO087: yeah
[  521.06-  525.40] FIO087: yeah design should be yeah it should be different all the almost all the remotes
[  524.22-  538.72] FIE088: like trend you know like we earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know maybe it should different colors or materials or you know so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shaped feels better in your hand or something you know
[  527.82-  533.04] FIO084: yeah maybe that can a little yeah can have those other shapes also yes
[  527.90-  528.82] FIO087: yeah exactly
[  530.68-  532.68] FIO087: always shapes also yeah
[  537.04-  537.48] FIO087: yes
[  538.08-  539.24] FIO084: yeah ok
[  538.52-  540.00] FIO089: ok friendly shape
[  540.00-  540.32] FIE088: yeah
[  540.00-  551.12] FIO089: that would help i think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them they can not find it
[  544.12-  544.56] FIE088: yes
[  552.52-  565.64] FIE088: that is true because they put the newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know whatever and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t v off and they say where the hell is my my remote control yeah
[  555.68-  556.72] FIO084: yeah
[  566.02-  566.78] FIO089: so so
[  566.14-  570.00] FIE088: well or yeah or if it is really if it is really in a dark spot
[  570.00-  575.80] FIE088: t that it keeps out a a sound or a signal or something so if lost
[  572.00-  574.68] FIO084: yeah or some beep or something like that so that we can
[  572.64-  576.76] FIO089: a sound so it should either beep or a light should blink
[  573.12-  573.24] FIO087: yeah
[  576.74-  581.44] FIE088: if lost signal throw a signal you know
[  577.04-  577.78] FIO087: should have
[  577.06-  577.36] FIO084: should have
[  578.58-  580.16] FIO087: a fluorescent signal yeah
[  580.38-  580.92] FIO089: yeah
[  581.48-  586.34] FIO084: yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can we can just recognize where it is yeah
[  585.68-  592.54] FIE088: exactly i mean just that is why i say i am just saying throw a signal meaning just whether it is a beep or whether a light or
[  587.00-  587.96] FIO084: may not be
[  590.86-  593.04] FIO084: beep or it is a light or it is a light
[  592.24-  600.00] FIO089: and do you think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would just
[  600.00-  605.72] FIO089: respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink
[  605.68-  630.00] FIE088: ok my my idea is maybe that the minute it is really hidden in in other words if it is like in a dark spot meaning you know like a newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or it is it is behind a plant at that moment it is it is like it is like what you call it the light se sensors you know in in that moment it has a sensor i i i it gets a certain darkness
[  625.56-  626.08] FIO089: ok sure
[  627.80-  628.00] FIO087: yes
[  628.28-  628.68] FIO089: ok
[  630.00-  637.20] FIE088: it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss that later you know
[  634.30-  637.64] FIO084: yeah probably yeah probably yeah yeah
[  638.22-  639.16] FIO087: yeah and
[  639.08-  641.24] FIO089: so the light sensor would activate the signal
[  641.30-  658.44] FIE088: that is right you know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think voice or clapping that is not specific enough i know there the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to a certain degree and
[  653.70-  654.08] FIO087: yeah
[  658.20-  660.00] FIO089: but it could be someplace really obvious
[  660.00-  661.76] FIO089: then you still would not be able to find it
[  663.98-  665.08] FIO084: post it and
[  664.08-  664.74] FIE088: what we
[  665.22-  667.92] FIO089: well because you are s because you are silly because people are silly
[  665.40-  666.24] FIO087: then your bookcase
[  666.12-  667.16] FIO084: post it
[  667.70-  671.60] FIE088: oh yeah well but then those people we can not help everybody
[  668.66-  680.00] FIO089: i mean it could be on well if you were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table you know i have maybe we have to move along ok
[  678.08-  683.96] FIE088: ok we have that yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good good points to start with here
[  682.08-  683.12] FIO084: yeah good point
[  685.84-  690.00] FIE088: ok the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you all did you get
[  690.00-  703.98] FIE088: notices on your computer for this ok so we will you will get the notice the working design i guess that is the function i d who is this the industrial designer that is you
[  691.64-  692.32] FIO084: for this
[  702.96-  703.28] FIO084: yeah
[  704.60-  707.72] FIO084: yeah it is functional de yeah exactly
[  706.82-  711.12] FIE088: ok so we looking for a working design when we come back
[  710.26-  710.70] FIO084: yeah
[  711.72-  715.68] FIO084: working design yeah it is it is maybe technical functional design
[  714.20-  714.50] FIE088: and then
[  715.72-  720.00] FIE088: and then the technical func you are the technical function so so you are the working design
[  717.24-  718.70] FIO084: yeah functional design yeah
[  720.00-  744.62] FIE088: so you have a working design and then a functional design and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general that would be your idea and of course price that it that it that the price is a good price i mean the price is given but that was
[  720.40-  720.78] FIO087: ok
[  745.24-  749.86] FIO089: we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
[  746.32-  746.80] FIE088: that is right
[  749.44-  750.00] FIE088: that is right
[  751.38-  758.00] FIE088: and you know persp you you will get specific instructions for that i think that is the end of the show but yeah
[  764.72-  775.96] FIE088: so we have well we have a time two two two three minutes any questions at this point or suggestions
[  777.80-  780.00] FIE088: i think basically basically you will get instructions
[  780.00-  787.08] FIE088: structions to work with and if you have any questions i guess you can
[  782.90-  783.20] FIO087: kay
[  787.58-  793.92] FIO089: ok i think i have enough to think about till our next meeting how about you people ok
[  791.24-  793.96] FIO084: yeah either it has yes i think yeah
[  792.80-  793.12] FIO087: yes
[  794.48-  794.68] FIO089: kay
[  795.56-  795.88] FIE088: ok
[  796.50-  797.60] FIO089: alright well
[  796.52-  797.80] FIO084: it will so let us see
[  797.96-  803.60] FIE088: then we see you in about thirty minutes let us see what we can come up with
[  801.88-  802.40] FIO087: yes
[  803.80-  804.52] FIO089: ok very good
[  804.08-  805.72] FIO087: very good yes
[  804.80-  805.08] FIE088: ok
[  805.48-  805.68] FIO084: yeah

============================================================
SESSION: IS1009b
============================================================

[   37.32-   38.66] FIE088: ok is everybody ready
[   39.72-   42.80] FIO089: and i could just put on my microphone here and i will hang out with you
[   45.12-   45.36] FIO089: ok
[   47.16-   58.68] FIE088: i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and
[   55.72-   56.12] FIO087: yes
[   60.78-   67.32] FIE088: i think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires
[   75.88-   77.04] FIO089: ok you want me to start right now
[   78.42-   79.04] FIE088: yeah
[   79.32-   86.44] FIO089: ok well could you put my slides up cause i think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time
[   86.28-   86.64] FIE088: ok
[   95.60-   97.04] FIE088: your participant
[   96.82-   98.86] FIO089: i think i will be at four i believe yes is it
[  100.68-  101.12] FIO089: kay
[  100.96-  103.74] FIE088: ok and can you please screen
[  104.22-  104.62] FIO084: ok
[  106.28-  107.52] FIE088: oh ok ok
[  108.48-  119.58] FIO089: there we go ok well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements is is part of my goal but why do i pass right to the second slide
[  110.40-  111.16] FIO084: i think that is fine
[  120.68-  150.00] FIO089: this that is where my discussion starts alright well since i am in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody and the reason i just put that there like that is that in the in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions you know you could say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run
[  150.00-  165.32] FIO089: your car it should heat up your motor it should turn on your c d heater whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we will have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility
[  155.16-  155.40] FIO084: kay
[  165.62-  180.00] FIO089: so i will be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it is going to be to add a feature or how expensive it is going to be or if your time is takes five years to develop this it is just something we can not do
[  171.68-  172.04] FIO084: yeah
[  174.56-  175.04] FIO084: yeah
[  180.00-  210.00] FIO089: so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can not be done for one reason or another and then the things that seem the most attractive that to to a customer will try to then prioritize those so that was what i meant there and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money because if we are going to sell
[  182.06-  182.36] FIO084: yeah
[  197.32-  197.64] FIO084: yeah
[  210.00-  213.22] FIO089: this thing i think the best time to sell it is a christmas present
[  213.64-  240.00] FIO089: twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase we want somebody to see it and think it is j i just got to have that and take out their wallet and buy it so it is got to be really attractive and it but it has got to go to market by september cause anything that you do not have already out there in september showing it around is not going to sell for christmas and then i will be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell
[  240.00-  261.02] FIO089: me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to h prior help me with that prioritizing of of the features and of the the look and the color and i will be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view
[  250.62-  250.88] FIO087: ok
[  260.98-  261.32] FIO087: ok
[  261.30-  270.00] FIO089: so i will be coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you and i will be coming to you to tell me what is going to make somebody take a
[  264.84-  265.54] FIO084: ok
[  269.24-  270.00] FIO087: what features
[  270.00-  292.06] FIO089: out their wallet you know what what is what what is going to really be what they call a sizzle cause we got to sell the sizzle a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view is not the thing that somebody is really just going to take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever ok can we go to the next slide please
[  275.70-  277.40] FIO087: sign a bit of a tickless
[  289.00-  289.28] FIO087: yes
[  294.86-  300.00] FIO089: alright i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looked
[  300.00-  330.00] FIO089: looks to me that within the budget that we are looking at the the whole house idea really is not going to be possible so i would like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything i would like the suggestions to be really specific so that we will have a list of things we can cross off not something like you know whole house control like we and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget
[  330.00-  344.60] FIO089: we are looking at and at the price point we are looking at we should be able to make it work the t v the v c r the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp i have to wind up
[  342.00-  360.00] FIE088: ok can can i at this point interject something we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered th the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that is the teletext because that is so
[  345.68-  346.38] FIO089: yeah sure
[  353.20-  353.60] FIO089: ok
[  360.00-  381.08] FIE088: of outdated with the internet and according to to higher management the it should only control the t v mostly because they feel that it is too comp complex a task to to to include other things and they are concerned with the time to market
[  361.12-  361.46] FIO089: ok
[  374.40-  375.82] FIO084: k of course
[  381.32-  382.12] FIO089: of course yeah
[  381.84-  382.38] FIO087: ok
[  381.96-  390.00] FIE088: ok and the and the third thing that they want to make sure that their that the corporate image is
[  383.08-  384.36] FIO089: ok so it is something
[  390.00-  420.00] FIE088: being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product so that it is easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company and that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out so i just wanted to inter check this here so we not getting too much off track here with with the things we want to look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things so it is only going to be t v
[  418.20-  418.92] FIO089: ok so
[  420.00-  425.10] FIE088: but the one thing maybe that could be eliminate is the teletext idea
[  425.40-  425.74] FIO089: ok
[  426.38-  427.28] FIE088: ok
[  427.00-  427.56] FIO087: ok
[  427.00-  450.00] FIO089: alright thanks for that alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now is a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use and that was thirty four percent even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room so
[  450.00-  478.72] FIO089: those are two things that we definitely do want to address we want to s make it as simple as possible we want to make it obvious and intuitive to use and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate ok can we go to the next slide please
[  479.64-  480.00] FIO089: ok
[  480.00-  509.82] FIO089: so my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle that is the selling point the thing that is going to make it an impulse purchase because once there is no be back well in sales they always say you know be backs do not come back if somebody says oh i will come back and get it next week you are dead they are never going to come back and buy it you have got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing
[  510.54-  540.00] FIO089: and in order to make it really saleable we have got to shorten the learning curve make sure it is really intuitive and easy to use we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that is why i am saying simplicity is good finding it is important obviously you can not use it if you can not find it so got to concentrate on the features that help you find it and i have already said this several times but i put it down in writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros so it has to have enough
[  540.00-  558.96] FIO089: value that when somebody looks at it they say twenty five euros i am not going to take that has to be so great that they are going to say oh twenty five euros is not much and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign ok that is about it for me right now
[  556.58-  556.82] FIO084: yeah
[  559.68-  560.08] FIE088: ok
[  563.04-  564.60] FIE088: and
[  566.00-  570.00] FIE088: who would be next i guess that would be
[  570.00-  574.80] FIE088: you you want me to get your slideshow out
[  571.20-  571.88] FIO084: yeah ok
[  573.36-  574.98] FIO084: yeah yeah sure thank you
[  580.82-  583.66] FIE088: and you are number three
[  582.48-  583.80] FIO084: number two
[  590.92-  591.58] FIO084: nice
[  591.62-  592.16] FIE088: right
[  593.76-  595.94] FIO084: well can you make it a full screen please
[  594.24-  594.66] FIE088: ok
[  595.82-  596.14] FIE088: ok
[  598.28-  598.62] FIE088: that one
[  598.40-  600.00] FIO084: no it is like a flat line
[  600.00-  601.24] FIO084: have to pass here
[  602.44-  605.92] FIO084: the cup cup should be third third
[  604.54-  605.26] FIE088: yeah yeah
[  607.72-  616.44] FIO084: yeah exactly so today i am going to talk about the working design of the remote controller can i go to the next sl slide please
[  607.98-  608.72] FIE088: yeah
[  613.30-  613.64] FIO089: ok
[  618.32-  630.00] FIO084: the method is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a le
[  630.00-  660.00] FIO084: elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connect connect connect your remote controller to a power supply from the you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery because remote control should be like you you you should take it to to wherever you want and then th this integrated circuit it t takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into into
[  660.00-  666.00] FIO084: infra infrared bits and it sends it it to the device like a t v or a air conditioner something like that so
[  666.44-  690.00] FIO084: a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like the the remote controller it sends some bits some f waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is it should re re recognize the waves which
[  690.00-  716.00] FIO084: are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote s remote controller will send a send a se send a signal and the t v it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that change the volume control and so i think it is hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices
[  700.22-  700.60] FIO089: signal
[  703.64-  704.20] FIO087: exy
[  707.08-  707.38] FIO089: yeah
[  715.86-  716.44] FIO087: ok
[  716.50-  720.00] FIO089: yeah well that is already been eliminated by management so we are off the hook
[  716.92-  720.00] FIE088: yeah it is yeah by itself
[  718.52-  719.06] FIO084: yeah yeah
[  723.56-  723.92] FIE088: yep
[  726.28-  750.00] FIO084: so user interface controls the chip and accordingly the message is like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that and buttons should be there so you can control whatever you want you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to mute mute the t v or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there should be sh there should be some device to tell
[  750.00-  760.40] FIO084: what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t v can perform the actions
[  754.00-  754.60] FIO089: ok
[  761.10-  763.16] FIO084: so can you go to the next slide please
[  762.34-  762.96] FIO089: ok
[  763.82-  780.00] FIO084: i i just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller i think these are the very simple features and they do not take much much of the investment also it is like the text or buttons which
[  780.00-  794.12] FIO084: which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they will be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark
[  795.06-  810.00] FIO084: and there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is th this is not a w w
[  810.00-  840.00] FIO084: you know action there there can be no action taken to that so and there should be a child lock like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can not be like you if you if you have k kids and all then they will be play playing with the remote controller so you can not lock the remote controller if it make it usable for more than one device it is a it is hard but i think it is possible for a person yeah yeah so
[  835.84-  840.00] FIE088: but well yeah well that has been a that has been eliminated so that is that
[  837.10-  839.26] FIO089: well that has been a that has been eliminated
[  838.76-  839.28] FIO087: yeah
[  840.00-  842.36] FIE088: unfortunately a mute point now
[  840.00-  853.50] FIO084: it is it is ok yeah yeah and different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands and so that
[  853.00-  861.68] FIO089: now that is good from a marketing point of view would be fun the fun shape and that you s you say that will not add too much to the budget to to the shape is
[  854.88-  857.86] FIO084: yeah yeah yeah and colors also different colors and
[  857.00-  857.40] FIE088: yeah i
[  857.28-  857.76] FIO087: yeah
[  860.08-  865.68] FIO084: no no like it will i do not think it will be like you can have you know for if you want that that to be
[  864.36-  867.48] FIE088: you just build a mold basically and you know
[  866.28-  869.26] FIO084: yeah yeah it is it is just a shape so it does not matter
[  867.14-  868.06] FIO087: yeah
[  869.28-  870.00] FIE088: is a budget we do
[  870.00-  874.62] FIE088: looking at if you build one mold i do not think that is going to make a big difference whether it is going to be square or
[  871.80-  872.32] FIO084: yeah
[  875.56-  882.68] FIO089: do you think there is any chance of having se having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
[  883.00-  885.70] FIO084: yeah that is also possible i yeah i agree yeah
[  883.56-  884.04] FIE088: oh yes
[  884.16-  886.82] FIO089: is that going to be a problem cause that might help with the marketing
[  884.66-  885.04] FIO087: yes
[  885.32-  891.84] FIE088: i think i think we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun
[  887.12-  887.76] FIO084: yeah that would be
[  891.20-  892.04] FIO084: yeah
[  891.44-  900.00] FIO089: because we had something sort of sexy for adults so we could have something sort of silly for children or a little adult shape or an or a
[  894.04-  894.32] FIE088: yeah
[  895.48-  896.60] FIE088: silly for children
[  896.34-  900.00] FIO084: yeah for children or a little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little
[  897.32-  898.70] FIE088: like an animal or
[  898.12-  899.60] FIO087: like a doll or
[  900.00-  900.28] FIO084: yeah
[  900.00-  903.28] FIO089: little elephant so they can remember where it is
[  902.10-  930.00] FIO084: yeah yeah yeah yeah and and the button buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated if you have less features then your remote controller will not be attractive so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in intended for two or three operations like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press
[  902.64-  903.48] FIO087: exactly
[  930.00-  939.00] FIO084: the other button in another mode it will change the color so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
[  938.60-  960.00] FIO089: well i think i think that that is something that we will have to discuss with the user interface person because i think there is a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature cause i think one of the things people were complaining about in my when i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one the changing modes with something i mean
[  941.96-  943.12] FIO084: yes
[  942.00-  942.48] FIO087: yeah
[  958.80-  960.00] FIO084: yeah it is like you have
[  960.00-  960.44] FIO084: yeah
[  960.00-  966.68] FIO089: you and i all for all four of us we work with computers all the time changing modes is nothing for us but people who
[  961.78-  962.00] FIO084: yeah
[  962.56-  963.36] FIO084: yeah
[  963.20-  963.80] FIO087: ok
[  966.72-  978.76] FIE088: yeah a little elderly a little arthritic hand you know and and it is a small button and and they they do not press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they are very frustrated you know
[  971.68-  972.24] FIO084: yeah
[  976.46-  977.80] FIO084: yeah exactly
[  977.00-  977.54] FIO087: yeah
[  977.52-  990.00] FIO089: it is and it is the kind of thing people learn by feel and you do not feel the mode change so maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help
[  981.76-  985.22] FIO084: yeah yeah you do not you should yeah yeah
[  990.00-  992.58] FIO084: yeah shapes also different shapes yeah that would
[  990.00- 1002.52] FIO089: to you know like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it but we will get to that with you
[  996.24-  996.88] FIO087: channels
[  996.40-  996.76] FIO084: yeah
[  998.44-  998.72] FIO084: yeah
[ 1000.80- 1006.30] FIO084: yeah yeah and also text should be very clear so that there there will not be any ambiguities for
[ 1001.00- 1001.92] FIE088: right
[ 1002.08- 1002.44] FIO087: yes
[ 1005.88- 1007.88] FIO089: that is right yeah yeah that is a good point yeah
[ 1007.06- 1007.88] FIO084: so yes
[ 1007.40- 1007.74] FIO087: yeah
[ 1008.92- 1020.00] FIO084: and display clock w if you want more features then we can display a clock it i d i do not think it will take any money extra money because i mean if we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely
[ 1020.00- 1021.80] FIO084: fit that feature into the circuit switch
[ 1021.44- 1028.90] FIO089: yeah that is that is a good that is a good one because the clock could be really friendly and when when is your favorite show coming on and
[ 1022.84- 1025.28] FIE088: yeah yes
[ 1023.12- 1024.40] FIO084: yeah yeah
[ 1023.34- 1023.76] FIO087: yeah
[ 1025.62- 1025.92] FIO084: yeah
[ 1026.92- 1031.50] FIE088: yes yeah and you seem to see already maybe you have no other
[ 1027.52- 1030.92] FIO084: yeah and then you in the in the c work on yeah yeah yeah so
[ 1028.08- 1029.40] FIO087: yeah you see
[ 1030.84- 1038.12] FIO089: yeah and a lot of time there is not a clock on the screen and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute yeah that is that is good the clock is good ok
[ 1033.16- 1033.40] FIO084: yeah
[ 1037.12- 1050.00] FIO084: yeah can you go to the next slide please components the main components we need for it are like buttons and underneath that there should be switch and bulbs
[ 1050.00- 1062.64] FIO084: like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the t v is on suppose then the remote controller should automatically have a s a light
[ 1063.84- 1078.80] FIO084: then it will be like if you switch on your t v through anoth another source not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light maybe we can have that whenever the t v is on remote controller will have a light
[ 1080.20- 1085.76] FIO084: and then infra red bulbs this is like when it is dark
[ 1085.56- 1086.36] FIE088: yeah
[ 1086.68- 1100.74] FIO084: and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations and wires connecting all chips switches lights everything so there should be wires
[ 1090.24- 1090.60] FIO089: ok
[ 1099.20- 1099.44] FIE088: yeah
[ 1099.88- 1100.28] FIO087: ok
[ 1101.68- 1110.00] FIO084: and o of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put
[ 1110.00- 1112.02] FIO084: to give a shape yeah
[ 1110.68- 1112.46] FIO087: to keep the remote please
[ 1113.08- 1113.52] FIO089: case
[ 1114.10- 1116.48] FIO087: keys holder holder remote holder
[ 1115.10- 1115.80] FIO084: yeah
[ 1116.12- 1117.38] FIE088: holder yeah
[ 1120.16- 1121.92] FIO084: yeah ok in a minute
[ 1122.88- 1124.64] FIO084: next slide please
[ 1126.12- 1138.50] FIO084: i have referred the site the home page of the our website from where i have i got s few points
[ 1140.20- 1141.48] FIO084: it that is it for me now
[ 1141.76- 1142.16] FIE088: ok
[ 1147.16- 1151.24] FIO089: so we should visit the site and have a look at what is up there or
[ 1151.62- 1152.74] FIE088: oh you do not have to
[ 1152.72- 1161.72] FIO084: it is not like that i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all the things
[ 1157.46- 1157.88] FIO089: ok
[ 1161.28- 1163.76] FIO089: ok so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
[ 1164.50- 1165.14] FIO084: yeah if you want
[ 1165.40- 1166.36] FIO089: ok thank you
[ 1165.68- 1166.46] FIO084: yeah sorry
[ 1172.84- 1176.08] FIO089: did you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up betsy
[ 1176.36- 1179.26] FIO084: it is actually there in there on the screen
[ 1179.44- 1179.80] FIE088: this one
[ 1180.12- 1181.12] FIO089: yeah ok thank you
[ 1197.40- 1199.18] FIE088: and i want to see
[ 1199.04- 1199.72] FIO087: i spend two
[ 1200.40- 1201.60] FIE088: you are two
[ 1201.06- 1202.74] FIO087: yes no no i am three
[ 1203.06- 1203.42] FIE088: ok
[ 1210.36- 1230.00] FIO087: you can make it full yes yes yes ok as a user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote yeah can you please go on to the next slide so i found out that the the
[ 1210.72- 1213.56] FIE088: would you want it full full screen yeah ok
[ 1230.00- 1238.22] FIO087: the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance
[ 1239.88- 1260.00] FIO087: now for that a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t v and it can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t v there should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infra red light or a led which can
[ 1260.00- 1267.92] FIO087: be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it
[ 1269.78- 1279.64] FIO087: now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice
[ 1279.00- 1281.68] FIE088: on on on their remote yeah
[ 1280.74- 1281.96] FIO087: yes yes
[ 1283.88- 1290.00] FIO087: so if if we want to view a particular program at say nine o clock he can set the time and the
[ 1289.44- 1289.64] FIE088: right
[ 1290.00- 1320.00] FIO087: v will automatically it will switch on at that particular time so he can use that kind of properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel and the the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compact
[ 1302.88- 1303.24] FIE088: yes
[ 1304.86- 1305.98] FIE088: by a child
[ 1320.00- 1321.52] FIO087: of the co remote
[ 1323.84- 1342.08] FIO087: it the remote should be compact and it should not it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t v television and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t an alphabet for more compactability
[ 1343.52- 1350.00] FIO087: and and and there is one more point which i noted it down like the material which
[ 1350.00- 1375.24] FIO087: which which is used for remote should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some el allergy to either children or to ed adult person and it should have an it can have an alarm clock a a person if so if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p m and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i do not think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote
[ 1374.92- 1378.90] FIO084: yeah sure if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock
[ 1378.02- 1380.00] FIO089: an alarm clock yeah that should be actually
[ 1378.30- 1380.00] FIO087: yes and as jan
[ 1380.00- 1397.72] FIO087: we said the buttons can be can we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
[ 1380.00- 1380.30] FIO089: right
[ 1399.14- 1410.00] FIO087: and the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote he he should not
[ 1410.00- 1411.38] FIO087: be harmed in any way
[ 1415.28- 1434.38] FIO087: and findings i found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used there are remotes which use the infra red for controlling the different functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
[ 1436.08- 1440.00] FIO087: so there you have different types of remotes with different lights so
[ 1440.00- 1445.14] FIO087: horse which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television
[ 1453.24- 1454.08] FIO087: next slide
[ 1456.32- 1470.00] FIO087: and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multi purpose use not no like it can it can be used as a t v control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a
[ 1470.00- 1492.28] FIO087: child lock and then to save electricity there should not be much s more m lots of circuits and all that and if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o clock automatically so that nobody else comes later and use it
[ 1491.24- 1496.78] FIO084: it is like a ok it is like a timer it is like a lock to the television
[ 1493.74- 1495.16] FIE088: timer yeah
[ 1494.32- 1497.72] FIO087: timer yeah and then you can use a timer as well
[ 1499.36- 1499.76] FIO087: yes
[ 1501.48- 1501.98] FIO087: i think so
[ 1502.88- 1505.82] FIE088: ok now
[ 1533.84- 1560.00] FIE088: on my slide so basically we already we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically there would be lunch break and all that however the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group and what function working design how how does it work so these are the two things we should come up with with
[ 1560.00- 1566.54] FIE088: so the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group
[ 1570.92- 1572.64] FIE088: i guess in many ways everybody
[ 1574.48- 1576.20] FIE088: everybody who has a t v
[ 1574.82- 1576.84] FIO084: yeah who has a t v yeah
[ 1576.56- 1577.92] FIO087: t v television movies
[ 1577.98- 1584.96] FIE088: yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who do not have a t v there are a few but in general not
[ 1581.70- 1583.48] FIO084: to do not have a t v yeah
[ 1587.08- 1590.00] FIE088: now talking about the target group which is
[ 1590.00- 1620.00] FIE088: in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have subgroups we have we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands so i think that is one group that is certainly important then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it is really very clear and
[ 1620.00- 1632.24] FIE088: i do not know how much we want to cater to children is use i mean that is a question whether that is important that children can really use it or not
[ 1634.48- 1650.00] FIE088: so this these are just some thoughts i have on it and i do not know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we are going to design this one thing or whether we are looking
[ 1637.08- 1637.64] FIO089: yeah
[ 1650.00- 1662.24] FIE088: at what we like we we are talking about different shapes whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups
[ 1662.76- 1680.00] FIO089: well you know there is the old motto children under six never shop alone so if you design something that is very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we want to go to the store and see it that has a lot of
[ 1680.00- 1704.68] FIE088: lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think i am i am talking about the functionality now on it whether we looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana color or whatever you know yeah for example you know but the question is really who is our target group
[ 1680.00- 1680.94] FIO089: marketing pull
[ 1692.74- 1693.14] FIO089: that is right
[ 1692.92- 1693.24] FIO084: yeah
[ 1692.96- 1693.74] FIO087: yes
[ 1696.48- 1696.92] FIO087: yes
[ 1697.62- 1699.80] FIO089: we can make a banana shaped one yeah
[ 1699.08- 1699.42] FIO084: yeah
[ 1701.20- 1701.60] FIO084: right
[ 1706.48- 1708.68] FIE088: do we look at one target group
[ 1710.54- 1720.90] FIE088: and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have i am asking the technical people here whether to look at
[ 1722.96- 1729.66] FIE088: so the subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
[ 1730.74- 1734.90] FIE088: out of the cost we are supposed to respect
[ 1733.46- 1734.98] FIO089: respect yeah
[ 1735.88- 1740.00] FIO087: ok no generally we can we can design a remote
[ 1740.00- 1757.76] FIO087: which is mainly for people with age from ten to forty and and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with we who have nervous problems yes
[ 1747.14- 1747.52] FIE088: right
[ 1755.38- 1756.16] FIE088: who is who is
[ 1757.68- 1764.44] FIO084: we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know yeah
[ 1762.98- 1763.72] FIE088: well that is that is
[ 1763.00- 1770.00] FIO087: but in a family in a family there will be a aged person children and a middle age but they cannot buy three different remotes
[ 1766.66- 1768.08] FIO084: and everybody yeah
[ 1770.00- 1776.22] FIO087: they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three
[ 1775.78- 1791.24] FIO084: yeah of course that we can do but specifically if if like elderly people want big buttons then you can not really make a bit big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote control for elderly and for children like in the definition
[ 1790.08- 1793.24] FIO089: what about the electronics that is not really going to change much is it
[ 1791.56- 1792.08] FIE088: yeah
[ 1792.20- 1793.24] FIO087: cost effective
[ 1792.94- 1794.46] FIO084: no it it does not cost
[ 1794.06- 1796.88] FIO089: that that w that will not change much will it
[ 1794.14- 1794.58] FIE088: no i
[ 1796.42- 1798.72] FIO084: no does not does not does not always
[ 1798.04- 1800.00] FIE088: the the quest the question to be addressed
[ 1798.08- 1799.10] FIO089: i i would not think so
[ 1800.00- 1830.00] FIE088: tier is only who is the target group and how will it function and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or subgroups the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense i mean the basic design i understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back if let us say forty
[ 1809.48- 1809.80] FIO089: yeah
[ 1821.76- 1822.12] FIO089: yeah
[ 1830.00- 1834.28] FIE088: percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
[ 1833.00- 1833.30] FIO084: yeah
[ 1834.48- 1834.80] FIO089: yeah
[ 1835.32- 1843.52] FIE088: so that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t v
[ 1843.62- 1860.00] FIO089: that is right and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes the same electronics and basically all that is going to be different is the playtime
[ 1844.24- 1844.54] FIO087: yes
[ 1855.52- 1857.48] FIE088: yeah well that is that is the question
[ 1859.48- 1859.88] FIO084: yeah
[ 1860.00- 1867.54] FIO089: lastic case and in that case we could proba molded plastic is not all that expensive is it we as an industrial person
[ 1866.14- 1870.16] FIO084: no i i do not think no i think it is not
[ 1868.48- 1890.00] FIE088: well maybe there is there is an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones they have like removable plastic cases so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that that in each package you know you have you you have you have
[ 1877.88- 1878.22] FIO089: yeah
[ 1882.62- 1882.96] FIO087: ok
[ 1887.24- 1888.80] FIO089: there is a real idea yeah
[ 1890.00- 1903.72] FIE088: example w you you have let us say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another color or a stripe or whatever that already comes in a package and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately
[ 1899.66- 1899.96] FIO084: yeah
[ 1900.42- 1900.68] FIO089: yeah
[ 1904.40- 1904.70] FIO089: right
[ 1904.62- 1911.32] FIO084: yeah like for mobile phones we have different you know covers like designs and all so that we can have that
[ 1905.08- 1906.50] FIE088: you know yes
[ 1905.20- 1905.66] FIO087: yes
[ 1909.04- 1909.28] FIO087: yeah
[ 1909.26- 1920.00] FIE088: that is right and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe or whatever they have as another one in the package then they can go to the store and for a few francs or
[ 1910.56- 1911.12] FIO089: right
[ 1919.20- 1919.42] FIO084: yeah
[ 1920.00- 1926.96] FIE088: euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example you know
[ 1922.28- 1923.22] FIO089: an alternate package
[ 1926.34- 1927.24] FIO089: ok
[ 1927.76- 1945.36] FIO087: but yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people
[ 1945.48- 1950.00] FIE088: well i think i think the idea here is to to to de design one remote
[ 1945.88- 1946.48] FIO084: yeah but
[ 1946.16- 1948.40] FIO089: well i think we could only afford different
[ 1949.70- 1950.00] FIO087: ok
[ 1950.00- 1970.56] FIE088: and what the only change is going to be the funct the t yeah the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children
[ 1950.00- 1950.08] FIO087: yeah
[ 1950.04- 1950.48] FIO084: yeah
[ 1954.04- 1954.72] FIO089: cosmetic
[ 1955.76- 1956.60] FIO087: yeah ok
[ 1959.48- 1959.98] FIO087: ok
[ 1972.86- 1975.56] FIE088: five minutes that was i guess that that is the old message
[ 1977.56- 1979.04] FIO089: we are you not finished moving now
[ 1978.28- 1980.00] FIE088: finish meeting now
[ 1985.06- 1988.94] FIO089: well we may have to come back to or to these points in our next meeting but
[ 1986.68- 1991.44] FIO084: yeah maybe yeah if we do some more research maybe
[ 1988.92- 2000.24] FIE088: but i think we d i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
[ 1999.40- 2000.80] FIO087: yeah
[ 2000.28- 2007.52] FIO084: yeah i think the w seventy percent is a unique more concurrent thirty percent yeah but
[ 2001.12- 2002.00] FIO089: ok well
[ 2001.44- 2002.48] FIE088: do we agree do we
[ 2004.74- 2010.00] FIE088: do we agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
[ 2008.24- 2009.92] FIO084: yeah yeah
[ 2010.00- 2010.28] FIE088: on
[ 2010.28- 2011.60] FIO089: ok fair enough
[ 2010.48- 2010.92] FIO087: yes
[ 2011.40- 2014.46] FIE088: ok so now i understand it is lunch break
[ 2015.48- 2016.32] FIE088: and
[ 2017.78- 2019.22] FIE088: so that is what we will do
[ 2019.24- 2019.68] FIO089: ok
[ 2020.16- 2020.44] FIO087: ok
[ 2022.20- 2023.24] FIE088: so thank you very much
[ 2022.84- 2023.28] FIO084: thank you
[ 2024.38- 2026.90] FIE088: and we will see you after lunch

============================================================
SESSION: IS1009c
============================================================

[   40.24-   40.70] FIE088: ok
[   42.16-   43.00] FIE088: hello everyone
[   43.24-   43.42] FIO084: hi
[   43.36-   43.80] FIO089: hi
[   43.76-   44.12] FIO087: hey
[   44.78-   47.18] FIE088: how how we doing
[   48.28-   48.78] FIO084: very good
[   49.26-   60.00] FIE088: first we going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less in the last meeting the marketing
[   60.00-   68.70] FIE088: manager had presented her method of working meaning gathering suggestions
[   69.96-   79.04] FIE088: from everyone to see how she best could market this this product at within the budget that was given
[   81.38-   88.20] FIE088: in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
[   90.00-  100.96] FIE088: it is also an item that people lose a lot so we should address that and of course it should be something
[  101.96-  104.16] FIE088: th that is very simple to use
[  105.56-  116.76] FIE088: in addition to that to make it sell of course the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
[  117.76-  120.00] FIE088: so that the people are buying it now
[  120.00-  130.04] FIE088: now because in particular with smaller items that is a very important fact cause if they say well i go home and think about it that will not work
[  130.80-  137.50] FIE088: also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve
[  138.68-  143.16] FIE088: and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
[  145.44-  150.00] FIE088: our technical manager has then said that
[  150.00-  151.56] FIE088: he feels it should have a chip
[  153.04-  160.34] FIE088: that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip
[  161.42-  172.64] FIE088: therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep if too many buttons are pressed
[  173.86-  180.00] FIE088: child lock and a
[  180.00-  183.72] FIE088: maybe a display clock so that people could
[  184.92-  191.44] FIE088: you could see the time you know what show they want to watch also mentioned was maybe different shapes
[  193.38-  203.56] FIE088: so the components of the thing should be button bulbs intra the infrared bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder
[  204.68-  208.54] FIE088: for the for the item
[  210.26-  228.56] FIE088: frentina who is our interface designer has mentioned that the there of course should have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock
[  213.74-  214.88] FIO087: interface designer
[  230.08-  240.00] FIE088: particularly with maybe small children that they could not watch a channel that is undesirable it should be compact her personal favorite was it should be t shaped
[  240.00-  247.94] FIE088: t and maybe have an anor alarm clock and the material should possibly be no of non allergic nature
[  250.22-  257.00] FIE088: the different systems that exist are infra red or radio waves
[  258.04-  264.80] FIE088: maybe it should have a electric electricity electricity saving feature
[  265.84-  270.00] FIE088: and even possibly a timer too so that people
[  270.00-  277.22] FIE088: can program their favorite program on right from the remote
[  277.32-  277.82] FIO087: yes
[  279.08-  285.08] FIE088: are we all in agreement that that is about what we discussed last time ok
[  284.28-  284.56] FIO087: yes
[  284.68-  286.62] FIO089: yeah we got pretty much as well you all have
[  286.88-  299.76] FIE088: ok then we i am looking for three presentations and i do not know whether the order matters much i do not i do not think so so whoever wants yeah ok
[  297.32-  299.26] FIO087: ok i can start first
[  300.00-  300.44] FIO087: ok
[  305.44-  306.74] FIO087: my slide please
[  306.10-  309.22] FIE088: ok right ok
[  314.20-  315.52] FIE088: ok oh sorry
[  321.44-  323.60] FIE088: and that is number two right
[  323.84-  324.10] FIO087: three
[  324.58-  324.84] FIE088: three
[  325.80-  326.68] FIO087: that has been three
[  328.04-  328.40] FIO087: yes
[  335.70-  336.00] FIO087: ok
[  337.52-  337.76] FIE088: ok
[  337.56-  347.12] FIO087: now as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
[  349.04-  350.04] FIO087: next please
[  351.32-  360.00] FIO087: ok now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television these messages could be switch on off
[  360.00-  371.24] FIO087: message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching on to a particular channel like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
[  373.38-  376.32] FIE088: nine what nine channel switches
[  377.32-  377.68] FIO087: padon me
[  377.96-  381.28] FIE088: nine channel switches is yeah
[  379.14-  380.92] FIO087: yes nine numbers
[  382.96-  390.00] FIO087: and then you have swapping button by which using which you can swap the channels if you do not want to see the third
[  390.00-  393.12] FIO087: channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
[  395.80-  407.92] FIO087: then it should have a next button a next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one next slide please
[  402.88-  404.08] FIO084: good
[  410.40-  415.92] FIO087: then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
[  418.10-  420.00] FIO087: then there should be a button which
[  420.00-  439.68] FIO087: can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen
[  441.92-  450.00] FIO087: then there should th there should be some buttons which can control features like the color color of the picture the contrast shine
[  450.00-  453.04] FIO087: sharpness brightness of the picture
[  456.76-  458.72] FIO087: now there should be a memory switch
[  462.72-  480.00] FIO087: there should be a mute button suddenly if if if a viewer he gets a telephone call and if he want he does not want to switch off the t v but he he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can but
[  480.00-  488.84] FIO087: while talking you can watch the t v now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
[  490.44-  495.72] FIO087: it is an integrated program programmable sample sensor speaker unit
[  498.52-  507.08] FIO087: so a remote can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizers you can record your own voice
[  510.40-  539.32] FIO087: which can be recognized by as voice recognizer in the television for example if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel the t now the the yeah the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel so the t v will have some recognizer which will recognize the user is voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
[  541.16-  545.28] FIO087: so this is one one of the interface which can be created
[  547.20-  552.30] FIO087: as very simple interface which has all the t important features
[  553.36-  554.42] FIO087: maybe please next slide
[  555.72-  570.00] FIO087: then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design
[  570.00-  578.10] FIO087: an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly even a kid can use that so can you go on th to the next slide
[  579.00-  592.82] FIO087: yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recognizer and this has multi purpose use it can be used for t v it can be used for cable satellites it can be used for v c r d v d s and audio
[  595.20-  597.66] FIO087: and this has inbuilt voice recognizer
[  601.64-  620.22] FIO087: can you go to the next slide yeah now this is an interface for a child for a remote which a child can use this is user friendly it is very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it and this comes with different colors different shapes
[  626.92-  630.00] FIO087: and this this child interface has many
[  630.00-  637.24] FIO087: buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact
[  638.16-  640.76] FIO087: attractive child interface
[  646.56-  657.84] FIO087: excellent please now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it is impossible to misplace and it is
[  656.32-  657.72] FIO089: you do not know me
[  660.00-  662.86] FIO089: i could lose that in a minute
[  661.14-  672.50] FIO087: this is i no this is a very big you cannot misplace it anywhere so this is a jumbo universal remote control it is impossible to i misplace or lose so
[  673.88-  676.48] FIO087: this this is one such interface which can be created
[  678.36-  689.86] FIO087: and the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognizers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function
[  690.56-  690.76] FIE088: great
[  691.96-  692.76] FIO087: thank you that is
[  711.48-  716.80] FIE088: ok thank you very much any comments on her presentation
[  720.36-  749.98] FIO089: well looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there what i am no suggestion is bad but we are going to have to narrow it down a little more i do not think that we can get the t shape is good the child one is good if they are too big to misplace i think it is just funny i do not think that is going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter it is going to be a little bit too on the
[  728.72-  728.96] FIO087: yes
[  740.40-  742.56] FIO087: ok yeah
[  742.28-  744.06] FIE088: yeah i i th i think
[  747.78-  748.52] FIO087: yeah
[  749.36-  750.00] FIE088: no i think
[  750.00-  763.20] FIE088: see these are her presentations but as far as the decision making we get into that after after but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation
[  750.00-  750.48] FIO089: wielding
[  751.60-  752.32] FIO089: yeah
[  754.76-  756.62] FIO089: have to come back to that later ok
[  755.64-  755.92] FIO087: we can
[  762.54-  766.68] FIO089: no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options
[  764.18-  764.42] FIE088: right
[  766.48-  769.48] FIE088: who wants to go next
[  770.12-  770.70] FIO084: yeah maybe
[  770.62-  772.20] FIE088: ok and you
[  772.08-  772.82] FIO084: discipline too
[  777.12-  777.78] FIE088: ok
[  778.30-  780.00] FIO084: the next one so
[  780.00-  781.22] FIO084: it is it is the
[  787.60-  789.96] FIE088: the components design yeah ok
[  787.60-  788.20] FIO084: come on
[  796.98-  809.44] FIO084: this time i am i am going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design can you go on to the next slide please
[  810.12-  824.20] FIO084: i have just brief done a few components which we require for the remote control construction the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera etcetera it is like
[  824.52-  840.00] FIO084: it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong even if you just you know if you if it falls down then it does not break so it should be strong and there are no harm
[  840.00-  843.48] FIO084: full materials used in that and it should be recyclable
[  845.22-  858.24] FIO084: and yeah and also using of coloring compoan compounds like if we want to have different colors blue red green so we have to use some coloring component component compounds
[  845.72-  846.54] FIO089: good point
[  858.84-  870.00] FIO084: and the second important thing is integrated circuit we sh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it is like the it is like the heart of the remote
[  870.00-  900.00] FIO084: controller if it is not efficient then everything w is going to be like less less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside it should it should be able to re resist the temperature high senator high temperature and low temperatures and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm for
[  901.40-  923.60] FIO084: and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like it is very very much important for the electricity flow through through through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a which is a i think it is it is like a battery capacitor can you go on to the next slide please
[  926.04-  930.00] FIO084: a diode a transistor a resonator
[  930.00-  941.04] FIO084: these are all this technical electr electronic components components which are which we have to use in a remote controller a battery i would like to suggest one thing if we
[  941.62-  960.00] FIO084: if we will be able to make a re re chargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can not l it can not charge much it it it is not a high voltage battery then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use
[  960.00-  967.48] FIO084: it for a long time so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w in that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
[  968.32-  978.48] FIO084: and we we have a circuit board in a remote controller can you go to the next slide please and how it works how the remote controller works when you press a button
[  984.52-  984.88] FIE088: ok
[  986.40-  990.00] FIO084: ok when you press a button when you do that you
[  990.00- 1017.70] FIO084: complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button and it will send some signals through the wires and then the chip will sense that connection and knows that which button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed it prou produces a mor morse score line signal specific to that button
[ 1018.28- 1020.00] FIO084: every button every individual
[ 1020.00- 1046.34] FIO084: button has its own morse code suppose the user has pressed button button one then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to p th that button and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the l e d which translates the signal into infrared light like you have got a signal by pressing a button that th th morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit
[ 1046.90- 1050.00] FIO084: now that signal that morse code has to be amplified
[ 1050.00- 1080.00] FIO084: by the transistor that is use of transist transistor we which we use in remote controller it will amplify signal and it will send it to l e d and which translates signal into an infra infrared bits sensor in t v can see infrared light and seeing signal seeing signal re it reacts appropriately that when it sees amplified mo more scored signal n it will it will know which what what action it has to do n it will do appropriate
[ 1080.00- 1084.06] FIO084: action so this is how the remote controller works
[ 1086.08- 1087.40] FIO084: can you go to the next slide please
[ 1088.18- 1097.76] FIO084: yeah i have few pictures when you look at the remote controller it is it is it this is a normal remote controller and and to the next slide please
[ 1099.16- 1110.00] FIO084: and we had a few buttons and all and if you open the remote controller you have this circuit circuit board and few electronic components like you can see a chip there
[ 1109.76- 1110.00] FIO089: oh
[ 1110.00- 1122.52] FIO084: which is having eighteen pence and also a capac a capacitor three resistors and also a resonator yeah and di and the diode transistor
[ 1110.00- 1126.08] FIO089: the
[ 1124.10- 1131.66] FIO084: the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and diode transistors and
[ 1134.12- 1140.00] FIO084: yeah the can you you can see the t a double one eight three five labeled
[ 1139.58- 1140.00] FIO087: yeah
[ 1140.00- 1140.46] FIE088: cheap
[ 1140.00- 1141.56] FIO084: cheap
[ 1140.80- 1141.08] FIO089: yes
[ 1142.74- 1163.88] FIO084: you can also see the the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors and just beside that you can see a transistor and a cylinder shape that one is a capacitor and also there are resistors sorry there there is a diode can you go go on to the next
[ 1161.96- 1163.36] FIE088: can you go go on
[ 1164.98- 1170.00] FIO084: so this is the circuit board the green one is a circuit board actually building a circuit
[ 1170.00- 1200.00] FIO084: bo board is pretty pretty easy and also it is it is l inexpensive it is it costs less than what you print on a paper because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires it is it is better to go for printing because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a on a bulk and it is just printing nothing like you know you do not need to use wires and all it is not exactly wires we are using it is just printing something
[ 1200.00- 1205.32] FIO084: on a board the tho those prints will act act as wires and cir circuits
[ 1206.72- 1230.00] FIO084: so th that green thing is a circuit board and also you can see there are like access for buttons like when you press a button the circuit under the button will be activated it will it will get some signals from it and it will it will ch ch s send the signal signals to the integrated circuit can you look at it next
[ 1224.56- 1225.00] FIO087: yes
[ 1230.00- 1230.68] FIO084: s please
[ 1231.24- 1239.04] FIO084: so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons can you see the black round marks they they are the circuits
[ 1237.84- 1238.12] FIO089: yes
[ 1239.98- 1260.00] FIO084: next please and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls b but a a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range
[ 1260.00- 1285.80] FIO084: like for sco rolls we have to go for a sophisticated and c a a a full complete chip and as energy source we offer a basic battery more engineers a hard dynamo a kinetic provision of energy modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy so that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells
[ 1260.00- 1260.28] FIO089: ok
[ 1263.62- 1263.84] FIO087: ok
[ 1285.30- 1286.54] FIO089: oh that is interesting
[ 1287.32- 1287.60] FIO084: yeah
[ 1290.00- 1301.62] FIO084: yeah the product can be de delivered into different cases usually the case is uncav flat that w we see usually a normal remote control
[ 1302.84- 1307.40] FIE088: ok you have more pictures we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
[ 1303.58- 1303.94] FIO084: yeah
[ 1306.72- 1310.80] FIO084: yeah maybe b i have just one more slide i think
[ 1312.14- 1320.00] FIO084: like we can have a m material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can not use and also for electronic
[ 1320.00- 1335.92] FIO084: so we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print also infra it includes the infrared senator sender yeah th and for the movie just to j develop a sample sensor a spea sample speaker
[ 1337.16- 1338.30] FIO084: yeah that is it
[ 1339.22- 1340.42] FIO084: it is all for me now thank you
[ 1340.32- 1341.12] FIE088: ok well thank you
[ 1342.48- 1345.76] FIE088: any particular comments by anybody
[ 1346.48- 1350.00] FIO089: yeah on the scroll and the push button can you
[ 1350.00- 1352.76] FIO089: can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
[ 1353.52- 1374.38] FIO084: no no no the the the the scrolling was different like you can go for s switches like buttons or scrolls which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think now nobody uses it because you need you need a c a c sophisticated chip and all so i think it is better we go for ordinary buttons yeah yeah push buttons yeah yeah
[ 1368.34- 1368.52] FIO089: ok
[ 1371.08- 1374.68] FIO089: we will just go for push buttons for in interest of cost ok
[ 1372.40- 1373.10] FIO087: yes push button
[ 1374.98- 1380.00] FIE088: we do not have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present
[ 1380.00- 1382.68] FIE088: inter her thing
[ 1381.16- 1383.48] FIO089: ok and go right to my first my next slide
[ 1383.84- 1384.86] FIE088: ok
[ 1386.40- 1410.00] FIO089: alright my method is i am interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i have really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers i s i spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing and then when i am out in
[ 1410.00- 1440.00] FIO089: people is houses or at meetings or anything like that i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it is convenient in the conversation i ask about it and i would encourage you all to do the same and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful people like something that really fits in their hand simple is beautiful they do not want to have to squint at small print they want buttons whose functions are obvious and they want as few buttons
[ 1440.00- 1470.00] FIO089: as possible and they do not l care for the mode thing they want each button to do something and eye catching is important it has got to look cute it has got to look appealing go ahead i am trying to finish fast for you and our preference is as far as i am concerned are we got to get to the market before the competition ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item and we should develop one
[ 1470.00- 1500.00] FIO089: or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign if we try to d sell people that has too many great features the consumer just gets confused and we do not get anywhere so we have got to narrow our selection down to two things i think that we are going to say are really great about our our our new product and i have been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular and people are
[ 1500.00- 1514.70] FIO089: tired of hard plastic and hard metal they are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them so those are things maybe we want to look at as far as salability of the item
[ 1517.16- 1520.28] FIE088: ok that
[ 1522.00- 1530.00] FIE088: concludes the presentation of everyone and what we really have to s decide in this meeting is
[ 1530.00- 1532.04] FIE088: the concept of the remote
[ 1533.62- 1540.16] FIE088: and so what do we think on the concept
[ 1541.12- 1541.94] FIE088: of the remote
[ 1545.20- 1548.96] FIO089: you want to try to come back to yours and limit your authority
[ 1547.66- 1551.84] FIO087: yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer
[ 1552.20- 1552.54] FIO089: ok
[ 1552.44- 1554.48] FIE088: ok
[ 1556.30- 1559.44] FIO089: so speech recognition is most important as far as you are concerned
[ 1559.48- 1559.80] FIO084: yeah
[ 1560.00- 1562.54] FIO087: this could be a one feature which could be sellable
[ 1562.76- 1567.92] FIO089: yeah that cou that could be that could be our star feature that that might be really good yeah i agree with that
[ 1563.52- 1563.74] FIO084: yeah
[ 1563.70- 1564.52] FIE088: you think that is
[ 1566.82- 1578.08] FIO084: yeah but but i am very very much doubtful how how far it will work because a speech recognizer like it it has its own problems issues
[ 1577.14- 1578.16] FIO089: distance problem
[ 1578.56- 1587.44] FIO084: yeah it is not distance problem it it is recognizing a person is voice like maybe different people will be having different voices so like it is everything so
[ 1584.88- 1585.28] FIO089: yeah
[ 1586.54- 1589.12] FIE088: well you you teach you have to teach
[ 1588.76- 1590.00] FIO084: so to get a good
[ 1590.00- 1593.24] FIO084: recogni recognizing system it is a cost you thing i do
[ 1591.20- 1620.00] FIO087: no it is it is yeah it is it is like you are recording a all a question already and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a t v system i am the user and my family members are the user i will already record a b a question like good morning like around eight o clock i want to see the news in the television so i would say just good morning and the t v will switch on it will recognize my voice and it will switch on
[ 1607.28- 1608.14] FIO084: yeah but yeah
[ 1619.40- 1619.68] FIO084: yeah
[ 1620.00- 1628.96] FIE088: ok before we get too far off here the components of the concept is the energy what kind of energy do we foresee
[ 1620.00- 1620.28] FIO087: job
[ 1630.36- 1636.60] FIO089: i think i think battery and i think we all agreed on that that that is that is going to be most cost effective and the best thing
[ 1630.60- 1632.20] FIE088: battery battery
[ 1633.76- 1634.10] FIO087: yeah
[ 1634.36- 1635.56] FIO084: yeah
[ 1637.00- 1639.26] FIE088: ok then chip on print
[ 1639.36- 1639.76] FIO084: yeah
[ 1639.78- 1640.00] FIO089: yeah
[ 1640.00- 1640.32] FIO087: yes
[ 1640.48- 1647.56] FIE088: ok and the case and i think we all agree on the case we want to have something maybe bright colorful
[ 1647.64- 1648.10] FIO084: yeah
[ 1648.16- 1650.00] FIO089: bright colorful trendy
[ 1648.80- 1649.70] FIO087: and combat
[ 1649.14- 1650.00] FIO084: brite colorful
[ 1650.00- 1652.04] FIO084: trendy design
[ 1650.00- 1652.30] FIO089: trendy trendy design and strong
[ 1651.20- 1652.90] FIO087: trendy design and compact
[ 1654.80- 1657.40] FIE088: trendy design compact and strong
[ 1657.46- 1657.94] FIO087: yes
[ 1660.28- 1666.44] FIE088: user interface concept interface type supplements
[ 1669.60- 1672.50] FIE088: that will be your area i think i yeah
[ 1674.28- 1678.84] FIO084: like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
[ 1678.84- 1679.54] FIO087: pushbuttons
[ 1680.00- 1682.28] FIE088: i guess for yeah
[ 1680.00- 1680.50] FIO084: buttons
[ 1685.20- 1686.06] FIE088: and
[ 1687.22- 1689.22] FIE088: not sure what they mean by supplements
[ 1687.92- 1688.06] FIO087: i
[ 1689.26- 1689.46] FIO084: yeah
[ 1689.78- 1696.56] FIO087: supplements like different types of features buttons they can have a mute button or a swapping button
[ 1689.90- 1690.60] FIO089: well i think
[ 1692.64- 1699.28] FIO089: yeah or like or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement her speech recognition feature would be a supplement
[ 1693.16- 1693.68] FIE088: oh like
[ 1694.98- 1695.28] FIE088: oh
[ 1697.00- 1699.24] FIE088: oh n right right right supplement
[ 1698.38- 1699.84] FIO087: reignizer yes
[ 1698.96- 1699.36] FIO084: yeah
[ 1700.12- 1707.26] FIO089: ok so why do not we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
[ 1706.32- 1707.44] FIO084: yeah
[ 1707.40- 1707.92] FIE088: right
[ 1707.56- 1707.98] FIO087: yes
[ 1711.60- 1726.84] FIE088: ok our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and the i d is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then to have the look and feel design
[ 1728.72- 1737.24] FIE088: and the u i d is supposed to come up with the user interface design
[ 1738.48- 1740.00] FIE088: and the marketing experience
[ 1740.00- 1758.10] FIE088: with the product evaluation in this phase the two of you jana and francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay it says here you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
[ 1742.36- 1742.80] FIO089: ok
[ 1748.76- 1749.26] FIO087: ok
[ 1758.32- 1758.88] FIO087: ok
[ 1759.54- 1770.00] FIE088: if you have any questions you know you you can always contact me or or your coach i suppose
[ 1770.00- 1771.12] FIE088: yeah
[ 1771.36- 1774.06] FIO089: where were there hiding
[ 1773.26- 1783.98] FIE088: so i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in i thirty minutes according to our time table here
[ 1781.40- 1781.76] FIO087: ok
[ 1787.52- 1788.32] FIE088: thank you very much
[ 1788.32- 1789.20] FIO084: thank you
[ 1788.36- 1788.84] FIO087: thank you
[ 1809.84- 1810.36] FIE088: oops
[ 1809.84- 1810.36] FIO084: oops
[ 1809.84- 1810.36] FIO087: oops

SESSION: IS1009d
============================================================

[   24.82-   25.04] FIE088: oops
[   24.82-   25.04] FIO084: oops
[   24.82-   25.04] FIO087: oops
[   24.82-   25.04] FIO089: oops
[   39.38-   41.32] FIE088: well hi everyone again
[   41.28-   41.56] FIO087: hello
[   41.32-   41.60] FIO084: hello
[   41.82-   42.26] FIO089: hello
[   43.24-   54.40] FIE088: like before we i have to reuse the meetings from the the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go
[   55.90-   60.00] FIE088: it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened
[   60.00-   64.64] FIE088: by the presentation from the interface
[   65.64-   66.88] FIO087: designer
[   65.68-   89.80] FIE088: designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages of course to the t v it should have nine channel buttons and next button volume buttons subtitle buttons switch to control features color contrast sharpness et cetera
[   90.20-  107.80] FIE088: should have a memory switch a mute button in case the telephone rings or something speech recognition is one of her very f favorite personal features she would like see to do to to be integrated in this in this new remote
[  111.92-  120.00] FIE088: should be child friendly design with few buttons colorful maybe with star shaped or other shaped buttons
[  120.00-  129.26] FIE088: she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
[  130.36-  135.06] FIO089: and she was challenged on that point
[  132.38-  133.32] FIE088: that is right
[  133.20-  134.56] FIO087: yes
[  134.84-  149.40] FIE088: but her very fer personal favorite really she she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote the industrial designer presented her
[  150.00-  164.38] FIE088: thoughts on the issue she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials should be recyclable and should be colorful
[  165.64-  171.16] FIE088: should have an integrated circuit port that is highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
[  172.84-  180.00] FIE088: she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated
[  180.00-  191.44] FIE088: technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitator diode transistor resonator and if possible a rechargeable battery
[  192.64-  194.72] FIE088: and of course a circuit board
[  196.00-  210.00] FIE088: and how it would works you press the button the chip is morse morse code related relays the to the genera to the generator amplification and
[  210.00-  220.00] FIE088: the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to to to consider
[  215.46-  215.72] FIO089: ok
[  222.16-  226.96] FIE088: she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
[  228.04-  232.64] FIE088: the scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
[  233.84-  238.92] FIE088: should be battery operated and of course would have the special cases
[  240.40-  262.72] FIE088: the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small
[  264.32-  266.54] FIE088: easy to use and it should be eye catching
[  270.36-  277.46] FIE088: from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does
[  280.60-  290.56] FIE088: to do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
[  292.12-  300.00] FIE088: too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really
[  300.00-  301.48] FIE088: driven home
[  302.88-  311.26] FIE088: it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that is really what people want today
[  312.92-  320.96] FIE088: and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer
[  322.18-  330.00] FIE088: the energy should be battery should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong
[  330.00-  331.90] FIE088: and and should have buttons
[  333.24-  337.98] FIE088: and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
[  340.72-  345.36] FIE088: now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
[  347.26-  347.44] FIO084: yeah
[  347.72-  351.12] FIO087: yeah just the look alike the button part i will explain
[  351.32-  351.56] FIO084: yeah
[  356.24-  360.00] FIO084: so this is what we have made this is a more
[  360.00-  390.00] FIO084: model of the remote controller which we are going to build this is a s in a snail shape so it it is attractive and it is it is blue in color bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons so it is look wise it is beautiful and also compact in shape and also y it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access
[  390.00-  391.28] FIO084: all the buttons easily
[  391.48-  392.98] FIO089: good
[  393.00-  396.64] FIO084: yeah
[  396.84-  400.06] FIO089: you used to have all the buttons
[  400.24-  412.76] FIO084: yeah and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and wh which which is strong and also for the
[  414.44-  419.96] FIO084: the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s s
[  420.00-  430.00] FIO084: soft rubber and yeah yeah because you will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it
[  422.28-  424.52] FIO089: oh that is good yeah that is also friendly
[  430.40-  442.40] FIO084: and then for the for the lead for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared
[  444.12-  448.76] FIO084: and and the button buttons part will be explained by f f
[  448.90-  450.00] FIO087: ok now the
[  449.10-  449.52] FIO089: ok
[  450.00-  469.58] FIO087: the we decided upon including certain features on our remote now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it is the led or l e d the infra red now we have included the switch on and off button
[  462.88-  463.96] FIO089: yeah
[  473.12-  477.04] FIO087: now we have included another feature that is the mute button
[  481.12-  487.68] FIO087: on the side of the model then we have included one to nine buttons
[  488.90-  491.90] FIO087: for controlling the programs the different channels
[  497.52-  502.64] FIO087: we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
[  507.38-  510.00] FIO087: and we have also included two buttons for scrolling
[  510.00-  512.94] FIO087: scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels
[  516.90-  521.36] FIO087: now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
[  521.78-  522.52] FIE088: what kind of button
[  522.60-  523.36] FIO087: menu button
[  523.68-  526.00] FIE088: menu a menu menu one one
[  524.16-  524.98] FIO087: is a menu
[  524.40-  525.14] FIO089: menu button
[  526.12-  526.96] FIO087: at the center
[  528.36-  536.48] FIO087: we have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color sharpness brightness
[  537.24-  539.68] FIO089: of the screen yeah
[  538.96-  540.00] FIO087: of this picture
[  543.00-  547.08] FIO087: we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
[  548.56-  553.80] FIO087: now this is a special special feature which we have included now this button
[  555.24-  569.16] FIO087: is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel
[  570.44-  573.52] FIO087: it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a
[  576.62-  577.56] FIO087: swapping button
[  580.40-  584.14] FIO089: the next channel in a numeric pattern or
[  584.12-  594.56] FIO087: no swapping is if for example you are you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap this button yes
[  587.78-  588.32] FIO089: yeah
[  593.76-  594.86] FIO089: ok ok
[  600.00-  609.02] FIO087: it this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which which will recognize the user is voice and then it will act accordingly
[  614.76-  619.88] FIO087: so this is a proposed model now the marketing expert has to
[  614.88-  615.30] FIO089: ok
[  620.32-  621.28] FIO084: tellering
[  621.20-  627.96] FIO087: give her suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective
[  628.20-  629.82] FIO089: ok well
[  631.12-  642.60] FIO089: what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb that you can really hold it in one you do not need two hands and it is easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah
[  635.32-  636.28] FIO087: yes yes
[  642.80-  644.80] FIE088: yes the buttons are all raised right
[  645.12-  659.40] FIO089: the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here so you do not have to turn it around turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that you really did a good job on that my little designers
[  645.28-  645.42] FIO087: yes
[  645.68-  646.52] FIE088: raised
[  649.70-  650.04] FIE088: right
[  653.18-  655.22] FIE088: all have two hands to operate it yeah
[  660.00-  671.18] FIO089: and i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place that is that is a really good good thing
[  670.80-  678.08] FIE088: yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you do not have to first go like oh yeah here it is on and it is yeah
[  672.20-  673.46] FIO089: yeah that is great
[  676.84-  677.88] FIO087: it is yeah
[  677.86-  686.32] FIO089: the color is very attractive the these buttons around here are the mute
[  687.44-  689.96] FIO087: no these the front buttons which are here
[  687.60-  690.00] FIO089: and these
[  690.00-  693.24] FIO087: are the mute buttons yes yes
[  691.60-  695.60] FIO089: on both sides the mute so you can push either one ok
[  694.40-  694.82] FIO087: yes
[  695.70-  698.06] FIE088: so if you are left handed or right handed it does not matter
[  697.04-  703.80] FIO089: and this brings the menu up on the screen this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
[  699.16-  699.48] FIO087: pardon me
[  699.86-  701.48] FIO087: this is the menu yes yes
[  704.04-  712.60] FIO087: the the these these two are the to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to scroll the program channels
[  708.12-  708.60] FIO089: ok
[  712.10-  714.88] FIO089: so ok very very good
[  714.08-  715.70] FIO087: scroll up or scroll down the channels
[  715.88-  718.44] FIO089: that looks looks like something i could sell
[  721.04-  724.10] FIO089: ok and now i am supposed to yeah
[  722.54-  733.80] FIE088: well i have one question will there be anything written on the buttons like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
[  733.84-  742.04] FIO087: yes it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols yes which can be easily like in this
[  735.22-  736.04] FIO084: yeah definitely
[  739.32-  744.40] FIE088: will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know does not have to first learn it
[  740.48-  740.64] FIO089: yeah
[  740.52-  741.60] FIO084: yeah
[  742.46-  742.96] FIO084: yeah
[  742.92-  743.28] FIO087: yes
[  743.52-  743.88] FIO084: yeah
[  743.72-  749.72] FIO089: good point because we need the symbols cause we are going into an international market we can not have anything that is language dependent
[  744.74-  745.12] FIO087: yes
[  746.14-  747.56] FIO084: yeah of course and also
[  747.96-  748.20] FIO087: yes
[  748.92-  750.00] FIE088: yeah yeah but
[  749.36-  749.72] FIO084: yeah
[  750.00-  756.14] FIE088: anyway it would i i it has to have some kind of of symbols text or something so that you can
[  751.60-  752.50] FIO084: yeah it
[  753.56-  755.44] FIO089: symbols
[  753.88-  754.32] FIO084: text
[  754.68-  755.18] FIO087: yes
[  755.40-  761.32] FIO084: text that we can have on the case itself we c it will be printed on the case and a symbol is like so yeah
[  757.68-  758.16] FIO087: yes
[  757.72-  758.04] FIE088: that is right
[  759.24-  761.56] FIE088: ok yeah just want to make sure of that
[  760.04-  760.40] FIO087: yeah
[  761.28-  768.08] FIO087: and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape a shell shape
[  761.58-  762.16] FIO089: ok
[  768.56-  780.00] FIO089: for the snail yeah we have the snail shell he goes right back into his shell well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we
[  769.28-  770.00] FIE088: right
[  769.28-  770.26] FIO087: right snails
[  769.42-  769.72] FIO084: yeah
[  770.42-  773.18] FIO084: so it is a yeah yeah
[  770.92-  772.24] FIO087: yeah snail shape
[  770.96-  771.12] FIE088: yeah
[  772.92-  773.32] FIO087: yes
[  773.28-  773.56] FIE088: right
[  780.00-  790.64] FIO089: could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would that would really work so
[  786.80-  788.12] FIO087: yeah
[  787.64-  789.22] FIO084: yeah yeah that would
[  790.04-  797.16] FIE088: now what what are our special features for the marketing that is really the voice recognition that is really unusual
[  796.32-  802.56] FIO089: i think voice recognition is our big selling point cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range
[  799.16-  799.92] FIO084: yes
[  802.76-  809.36] FIE088: and then and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use
[  810.00-  823.32] FIO089: well i think that everybody is going to say their remote control is practical i think we have to we have to dwell on on on the appearance you are really going to have the beth the
[  811.08-  811.60] FIE088: you know
[  816.96-  817.84] FIE088: colors
[  824.16-  824.64] FIE088: cutest
[  824.44-  837.62] FIO089: cutest remote control on the block so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the look
[  826.94-  827.10] FIE088: yeah
[  838.96-  840.00] FIO089: and the voice recognition
[  840.00-  841.84] FIO089: and they are going to be our two selling points
[  842.92-  845.58] FIE088: ok now having said that
[  845.56-  847.60] FIO089: i am supposed to make a little presentation are not i
[  848.64-  855.76] FIE088: no no this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done now we are going to talk about financing
[  851.40-  852.44] FIO089: ok
[  856.64-  862.76] FIO089: but in my instructions i think it is when we are supposed to go to the board and do something no
[  862.78-  864.84] FIE088: well there is a production evaluation is that you
[  865.16-  865.66] FIO089: yeah that is me

[ 1052.36- 1054.28] FIE088: so we looks like we are
[ 1055.64- 1056.56] FIE088: well within budget
[ 1057.00- 1057.44] FIO087: ok
[ 1057.86- 1058.42] FIE088: ok
[ 1060.92- 1062.72] FIE088: i guess i should save this i suppose
[ 1062.92- 1063.24] FIO089: yeah
[ 1069.00- 1069.34] FIE088: yops
[ 1080.00- 1081.08] FIE088: ok
[ 1084.98- 1085.98] FIO087: in the desktop
[ 1086.62- 1091.44] FIE088: i just write that my documents computer my documents here is yes
[ 1089.86- 1091.00] FIO084: i think you should say
[ 1096.84- 1098.90] FIE088: kay fine i will say
[ 1101.40- 1109.80] FIE088: ok good so that is the good news we are going to be popular
[ 1111.64- 1114.24] FIE088: so that i think financing was pretty simple
[ 1115.36- 1121.66] FIE088: now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
[ 1122.16- 1124.48] FIO089: ok i will take my file now so you can bring it up
[ 1137.90- 1138.90] FIO089: ok should be able to get it in
[ 1142.72- 1145.02] FIO089: kay why not you move just to the next slide right away
[ 1146.00- 1148.00] FIE088: you want to go to the next slide ok
[ 1146.88- 1170.00] FIO089: yeah ok ok well obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question will it sell and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we have not thought of we can not accept every suggestion
[ 1165.36- 1165.88] FIO087: ok
[ 1166.98- 1167.44] FIO084: yeah
[ 1170.00- 1195.36] FIO089: course but maybe we just need to get a few and show the the prototype to consumer research groups we do not s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we will not sell any so we have to get some input from those people and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition you know we like it we think it is good we are going to get behind it and sell it next slide please
[ 1171.28- 1171.60] FIO084: yeah
[ 1197.80- 1200.00] FIO089: ok now the things that i am
[ 1200.00- 1230.00] FIO089: was thinking and the my wish list has really been realized in this prototype i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i did not want anything with angles and all square i wanted to be comfy and roundy so we have we have got that the size is small the colors bright and warm which is what we wanted we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped even though it is going to be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that is nice and functionality i put last on my list because people are not going to
[ 1230.00- 1243.44] FIO089: it before they buy it so paradoxically the other features in other words the look the feel and the shape that is what people are going to get in the store they do not have a television in the store they can not play with it
[ 1238.78- 1240.32] FIO087: same
[ 1240.76- 1241.20] FIO084: yeah
[ 1243.40- 1243.76] FIO084: yeah
[ 1243.74- 1244.06] FIO087: yes
[ 1243.78- 1260.00] FIO089: so they will be our main selling points so tho those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please ok so the shape i think is a a one
[ 1260.00- 1284.08] FIO089: that is really really excellent shape the size is small and these points are in the importance for the for the marketing these are not in how i feel i think that it is i think that it is plenty small enough to sell but i think we are sort of right the scale is one to seven i think we are sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors
[ 1284.56- 1290.00] FIO089: and our color i think is great the colors are bright and warm and we really do a great job there and
[ 1290.00- 1313.80] FIO089: and given the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible and then functionality i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have added added different functions but then we would disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality so i think that basically we have got a great product and we can get off and running with it
[ 1314.20- 1320.00] FIE088: i just realized one thing in the financing there was no room
[ 1317.48- 1317.86] FIO089: yes
[ 1320.00- 1321.80] FIE088: m for our voice recognizer
[ 1322.50- 1323.16] FIO087: yes
[ 1323.32- 1323.68] FIO084: yeah
[ 1324.28- 1331.80] FIE088: and i do not know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that to
[ 1331.44- 1335.82] FIO089: well we had what eight eight euros twenty as our cost
[ 1335.54- 1337.12] FIE088: eight eight twenty yes
[ 1336.76- 1337.62] FIO084: eight twenty so
[ 1337.30- 1341.08] FIO089: and so we have got we have still got four euros to go to spend
[ 1338.22- 1340.90] FIO084: beer than four more euros yeah
[ 1341.16- 1346.16] FIE088: i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty
[ 1346.02- 1348.12] FIO089: well that is
[ 1347.68- 1350.00] FIE088: but i mean we have no way or
[ 1350.00- 1360.84] FIE088: of presenting that to management as you know as a finished as a finished product and saying ok with a r voice recognizer that costs so much
[ 1362.02- 1370.84] FIE088: so we just have to be aware of that i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that
[ 1371.50- 1380.00] FIO089: well as we know in today is technol technological world you can do just about anything at any price the the problem is quality so we are just going to
[ 1371.64- 1371.88] FIO084: yeah
[ 1379.20- 1380.00] FIO084: yeah
[ 1380.00- 1380.76] FIO084: definitely
[ 1380.00- 1394.88] FIO089: have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway as we have seen with so many of these kind of products
[ 1381.86- 1383.16] FIO084: yeah it is yeah
[ 1382.50- 1383.56] FIO087: yeah
[ 1389.52- 1390.32] FIO084: yes
[ 1389.86- 1390.16] FIE088: yeah
[ 1394.88- 1410.00] FIE088: i am sorry to interrupt that but i just reco i just remembered that there was no that that was not included that there was no room for any special features ok so it would be aware of that
[ 1402.40- 1403.46] FIO084: yeah
[ 1407.28- 1407.66] FIO087: yeah
[ 1410.00- 1413.28] FIE088: that you want to go to this next slide marketing expert
[ 1412.52- 1419.42] FIO089: well i is not this my last slide yeah ok i think that was my last slide yeah
[ 1415.40- 1418.16] FIE088: i do not know yes it is for a whiteboard

[ 1500.00- 1501.78] FIO089: it is just average
[ 1502.48- 1503.88] FIE088: i dunno
[ 1505.16- 1507.00] FIE088: i think i would give it at least a two
[ 1507.16- 1507.68] FIO089: ok
[ 1509.74- 1510.10] FIO087: one
[ 1511.76- 1514.40] FIO084: yeah even i think it is one it is way too much
[ 1513.38- 1523.24] FIO089: ok yeah ok you are the designer of course you will not give me one and then how about how we doing it on color
[ 1525.96- 1526.90] FIE088: color i i
[ 1526.68- 1530.00] FIO089: color i gave it a one i really like all the nice bright one

[ 1531.84- 1532.30] FIO089: one
[ 1532.66- 1533.42] FIO084: yeah one
[ 1534.04- 1538.40] FIO089: one one one ok and how about the feel
[ 1541.26- 1546.80] FIO089: taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand
[ 1547.76- 1549.72] FIE088: i think i would give it a two
[ 1550.50- 1554.62] FIO089: ok i can give it a three two three
[ 1553.04- 1553.80] FIO087: i will give three
[ 1555.70- 1557.56] FIO084: maybe two yeah
[ 1556.88- 1557.88] FIO089: two ok
[ 1559.20- 1560.00] FIO089: and
[ 1560.00- 1566.74] FIO089: linux is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here but
[ 1569.22- 1577.84] FIE088: well it is also you can not really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but
[ 1571.88- 1572.40] FIO089: yeah
[ 1580.88- 1582.04] FIE088: i will give it a three
[ 1582.24- 1583.40] FIO089: ok
[ 1586.28- 1586.44] FIO087: two
[ 1586.86- 1587.76] FIO089: two ok
[ 1588.68- 1590.00] FIO084: three three
[ 1592.00- 1592.62] FIO089: ok
[ 1594.32- 1595.56] FIO089: well
[ 1598.04- 1619.10] FIO089: it looks like we have got got ourselves a pretty good product functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having a meeting having another meeting but otherwise i think we we are ready to go to go with this product
[ 1611.98- 1612.80] FIO084: yeah
[ 1620.68- 1625.02] FIO089: anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate
[ 1637.64- 1644.16] FIE088: here is what we are looking at satisfaction for example room for creativity
[ 1650.00- 1653.92] FIE088: there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
[ 1655.32- 1655.96] FIO084: yeah we can
[ 1655.36- 1657.24] FIO087: we can always improve yes
[ 1656.82- 1674.60] FIO084: yeah include some more buttons and yeah features we can make the buttons few buttons smaller i think they are quite big so i think i mean we we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case if we want to have more features in that
[ 1658.68- 1659.78] FIO087: yes features
[ 1674.44- 1674.80] FIO089: ok
[ 1676.42- 1680.00] FIO089: well then again if we are going to do this feature
[ 1680.00- 1702.92] FIO089: recognition thing where go there going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that or the recording of the the speech so that that is where we are going to have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons and then maybe we can do something with the
[ 1681.20- 1681.52] FIO084: yeah
[ 1684.04- 1685.16] FIO084: yeah definitely
[ 1684.80- 1685.36] FIO087: yes
[ 1687.28- 1687.90] FIO087: voices
[ 1693.38- 1696.64] FIO084: yeah let us make yeah two mute yes
[ 1693.92- 1694.50] FIO087: yes
[ 1695.76- 1695.98] FIO087: yes
[ 1704.24- 1707.88] FIO089: the volume control maybe we can put that all on one button
[ 1710.00- 1718.04] FIO089: and a couple of other c maybe comp consolidate some of the usage and and see what we can do with that
[ 1718.58- 1740.00] FIE088: yeah i am always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can not with this particular item we probably can not just add a whole lot of more things we need you know we need to leave space
[ 1719.06- 1720.48] FIO087: maybe
[ 1732.90- 1733.28] FIO089: no
[ 1733.96- 1734.38] FIO084: yeah
[ 1740.00- 1743.96] FIE088: money wise for the voice recognizer
[ 1745.56- 1745.92] FIO084: yeah
[ 1749.86- 1766.58] FIE088: so the the question really is how do we feel with the project process are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created
[ 1768.06- 1770.00] FIE088: i think personally i think
[ 1770.00- 1771.44] FIE088: i am pretty happy
[ 1771.70- 1775.98] FIO089: i am pretty happy with the thing yeah it is something i think i can market yeah
[ 1772.48- 1773.32] FIO084: yeah
[ 1772.58- 1774.00] FIE088: and
[ 1775.24- 1775.52] FIO084: yeah
[ 1776.12- 1782.78] FIE088: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
[ 1782.72- 1786.96] FIO089: well i think you have done a good job to sleep in
[ 1784.02- 1786.68] FIO087: yes yeah definitely
[ 1784.36- 1786.46] FIO084: yeah that makes sense they definitely do
[ 1785.86- 1791.68] FIE088: and i think teamwork i think was very very good i think we really did work
[ 1789.80- 1793.02] FIO089: yeah i think only two i think we work well together as a team you know
[ 1790.06- 1790.36] FIO084: yeah
[ 1791.04- 1791.36] FIO084: yeah
[ 1792.56- 1793.28] FIE088: and
[ 1793.98- 1800.00] FIE088: and i think we are we happy with the means we used we used quite
[ 1800.00- 1803.16] FIE088: board we did not use digital p well digital pens i guess all these things
[ 1803.22- 1808.12] FIO089: oh maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more we do not use that enough
[ 1804.92- 1807.86] FIO087: white board yes yeah that is a
[ 1806.36- 1807.56] FIO084: yeah
[ 1807.44- 1822.00] FIE088: yes we could it is maybe not in the best position in the room you know like sometimes it is positioned so that it is much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit
[ 1822.04- 1824.20] FIO089: and we used the slide because it was better positioned
[ 1824.12- 1830.00] FIE088: yes i think so i think absolutely and f fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a leap
[ 1824.40- 1824.72] FIO084: yeah
[ 1825.36- 1826.70] FIO089: oh so that is true
[ 1830.00- 1835.28] FIE088: easier did we knew did we find new ideas i think we did
[ 1830.94- 1831.38] FIO087: yes
[ 1835.40- 1836.76] FIO084: yeah
[ 1835.44- 1837.98] FIO089: i think we were we were very good at that
[ 1837.28- 1844.68] FIE088: i think we we did in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here
[ 1846.50- 1846.72] FIO089: ok
[ 1847.20- 1858.60] FIE088: are the costs within budget yes yes is the project evaluated yes then celebration
[ 1851.90- 1852.60] FIO089: yes yes
[ 1853.74- 1860.00] FIO089: celebration today we have apple juice
[ 1854.98- 1858.48] FIO087: celebration
[ 1855.88- 1858.84] FIO084: i do not exist
[ 1860.00- 1865.54] FIO089: and after we sell million of em we have samples
[ 1864.64- 1871.52] FIE088: so i i thank you all very much i think this was very good and
[ 1869.94- 1870.52] FIO089: ok
[ 1872.72- 1880.86] FIE088: i think we did come up with a new product that is feasible feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view
[ 1874.48- 1876.90] FIO089: ok
[ 1882.80- 1884.12] FIE088: so thank you
[ 1883.00- 1883.24] FIO089: ok

[ 1896.56- 1898.82] FIO084: do we still have some time left
[ 1901.10- 1902.64] FIO084: you have
[ 1902.92- 1904.02] FIO087: they say it is forty minutes

[  182.68-  182.86] MTD011UID: yeah
[  189.68-  189.84] MTD011UID: no
[  190.88-  192.64] MTD012ME: i can take very much attention to that but
[  193.52-  193.96] MTD009PM: ok
[  196.04-  210.00] MTD009PM: let me see if it works this one no it does not work here ok no problem but on the corporate information side there is there was real
[  210.00-  240.00] MTD009PM: remote instead of real reaction real remote is not really the company we are we are but ok ok what are we going to do our project aim is as you can see a new remote control it has the original trendy and user friendly so these are the points why we also hired you we have got the more
[  212.16-  212.68] MTD012ME: oh yeah
[  216.08-  216.80] MTD011UID: ok
[  238.32-  238.60] MTD012ME: ok
[  240.00-  252.14] MTD009PM: practing expert for the trendy and user friendly look and industrial designer that is also user friendly and original
[  253.40-  258.96] MTD009PM: and we have got our user interface designer yep that is also
[  257.20-  257.32] MTD011UID: yep
[  260.36-  262.06] MTD009PM: that is about the new remote control
[  263.16-  270.00] MTD009PM: project method is the there are three phases we are going
[  270.00-  279.92] MTD009PM: through first is functional des and a design in the virtual work meetings after the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
[  281.24-  286.86] MTD009PM: i had some little indications in here
[  288.20-  300.00] MTD009PM: but i think you know it already by yourself the industrial designer is going to work on the working design components design and a bit of the look and feel design
[  300.00-  328.16] MTD009PM: the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface concept and user interface design and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements specification trend watching and project product ev evaluation so that is a bit what you are going to do but that will be all worked out in other meetings
[  332.18-  360.00] MTD009PM: then we have got our first tool training we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it is it is handy if we have a little bit of training first as you can see we have got the smart boards here and here in the whiteboard in the whiteboard here is a little toolbar on this side here are some functions we can save these functions we do not have anything
[  360.00-  362.52] MTD009PM: do it only undo you can undo a little
[  363.90-  390.00] MTD009PM: a piece of drawing a blank new document for each person select a pen razor capture we do not have to do anything with then we have got our pen this pen it is really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the i think it is format you can also
[  380.18-  380.66] MTD012ME: ok
[  390.00-  408.74] MTD009PM: select the current color and the line width but then first you have to select the pen function which we are going to work with it in a minute ok that is very simple and it is easy to draw your findings and drawings in there
[  410.00-  410.80] MTD009PM: then
[  412.40-  420.00] MTD009PM: a short thing about documents we have got our shared folder project m fr project what was it project
[  420.00-  436.96] MTD009PM: documents i think but all you all found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be ok and these are available on the smart boards as well so if you have a document you want to show just open some of the folders
[  435.26-  435.64] MTD011UID: ok
[  439.40-  449.48] MTD009PM: here is the simple toolbar that is what i just said save print move back or forward one page you can switch between the different ones
[  452.64-  454.80] MTD009PM: and then we are going to try out the whiteboard
[  456.78-  469.32] MTD009PM: so as you can see we are go going to draw an animal just to yeah you see we are getting a bit familiar with it the mouse just running away
[  469.28-  470.06] MTD012ME: that is interesting
[  471.32-  477.20] MTD009PM: is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ok we are going to draw an animal
[  475.30-  475.78] MTD012ME: yes
[  478.28-  480.00] MTD009PM: and just
[  480.00-  508.00] MTD009PM: up a few of its favorite characteristics the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different line width thus i can start from now you can use this pen by holding it like like a little child because if you hold it like this the sensors will get blocked and and the point will not get good
[  506.20-  506.56] MTD011UID: ok
[  506.74-  506.94] MTD012ME: ok
[  509.30-  510.00] MTD009PM: another thing is you
[  510.00-  540.00] MTD009PM: you have to be a bit slow cause if you got me to draw like really fast then pen will not hold up so we choose format current color i think gray is appropriate then the alignment meaning seven will be nice now you will see my drawing capabilities which are not very much
[  540.00-  545.80] MTD009PM: i have to do a bit of slow
[  554.36-  555.36] MTD009PM: oh that is a good time
[  569.80-  570.00] MTD011UID: sure
[  570.00-  570.20] MTD011UID: are
[  571.12-  578.00] MTD009PM: he is trying to draw a dot i think it is not so it is a bit of a it is going to help
[  577.62-  578.92] MTD012ME: i am not thinking about a sword function
[  579.62-  583.30] MTD009PM: sort yeah it is it is a bit of a sort of a little bit of an eye
[  579.90-  580.64] MTD011UID: yeah
[  583.80-  585.16] MTD0010ID: oh
[  584.94-  591.96] MTD009PM: well now we have got another function you have got the eraser and then you can undo
[  593.54-  595.76] MTD009PM: this easily
[  595.68-  595.96] MTD012ME: yeah
[  596.84-  600.00] MTD009PM: it is ok and i am going to do
[  600.00-  606.92] MTD009PM: we will write down a few of his characteristics
[  612.42-  614.68] MTD009PM: we have got the text tool
[  617.56-  617.72] MTD009PM: oh
[  629.52-  630.00] MTD009PM: ok
[  630.00-  637.60] MTD009PM: this is typically a a blue action i think it is a thing
[  634.00-  635.42] MTD012ME: no
[  639.88-  641.08] MTD009PM: maybe you have to hold it a bit
[  643.00-  653.20] MTD009PM: left side i think that is it because if you want a a a this then it will be a stripe i do not know just stripe
[  658.42-  660.00] MTD009PM: it is not my
[  660.00-  663.00] MTD009PM: no ok maybe it is interesting
[  670.80-  671.26] MTD009PM: oh no
[  684.56-  689.80] MTD009PM: i think it wants to draw another i do not know
[  691.56-  693.20] MTD009PM: this for the fun
[  694.96-  695.44] MTD009PM: sorry
[  700.24-  714.08] MTD009PM: my characteristic i characteristic but dog lifts with fun so now i am going to hand over pen on the new plane sheet will you go actually
[  704.56-  705.04] MTD012ME: ok
[  704.98-  705.28] MTD011UID: ok
[  712.06-  712.46] MTD012ME: ok
[  714.34-  716.30] MTD012ME: ok
[  721.28-  722.50] MTD012ME: we will use a different language
[  724.64-  726.14] MTD012ME: and i am going to draw it like
[  729.64-  735.84] MTD012ME: there ok i am not much in the lightest but here we go
[  743.56-  750.00] MTD009PM: maybe it is easier to draw the smaller line with i think because this is going a little bit in the
[  750.00-  751.26] MTD009PM: no i did
[  767.04-  767.48] MTD011UID: sheep
[  803.24-  808.34] MTD012ME: ok this is my
[  812.20-  812.60] MTD012ME: sheep
[  818.22-  819.84] MTD009PM: it is nice
[  820.50-  821.64] MTD012ME: of course
[  829.94-  833.20] MTD012ME: the new dot name is it is right on their butts
[  830.04-  830.48] MTD009PM: but
[  834.98-  840.00] MTD009PM: it is a real dutchy recognition yeah i see
[  835.08-  835.66] MTD012ME: very good
[  836.52-  837.40] MTD012ME: yeah
[  840.00-  840.80] MTD009PM: ok
[  843.08-  846.24] MTD009PM: maybe you can also write your name somewhere just
[  843.56-  843.80] MTD012ME: ok
[  846.48-  846.94] MTD012ME: they are
[  849.34-  849.76] MTD012ME: ok
[  858.82-  860.48] MTD012ME: let us go really slow as the plane
[  861.60-  862.42] MTD009PM: yeah
[  879.44-  883.16] MTD012ME: they are really animals and that is just a little real thing
[  884.44-  884.76] MTD012ME: so
[  888.54-  891.92] MTD012ME: this all has some time to our using this
[  889.60-  895.88] MTD011UID: ok so i am just going to draw it
[  889.78-  890.20] MTD009PM: right
[  897.90-  898.40] MTD011UID: let us see
[  965.88-  967.52] MTD011UID: ok
[  969.90-  972.28] MTD009PM: sweet
[  971.52-  973.52] MTD011UID: yeah do you know what that is
[  975.48-  977.60] MTD012ME: a rubber yeah
[  975.72-  976.32] MTD0010ID: carfew
[  976.48-  977.60] MTD011UID: ok yeah
[  978.48-  978.82] MTD011UID: just
[  983.16-  984.30] MTD011UID: ok
[  986.52-  987.76] MTD011UID: so
[  990.18-  991.54] MTD011UID: yeah it is
[  993.06-  995.22] MTD011UID: you said right or
[  994.96-  996.66] MTD009PM: yeah use the blank
[  996.38-  997.04] MTD011UID: shake it
[ 1009.34- 1020.00] MTD0010ID: well i was going to draw a cat too so let us try something else something different than
[ 1017.52- 1017.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1020.00- 1020.60] MTD0010ID: carfuel
[ 1039.84- 1042.46] MTD0010ID: mine is a bit more skinny
[ 1041.12- 1043.52] MTD009PM: yeah a skinny cat
[ 1041.64- 1042.32] MTD012ME: yeah oh man
[ 1044.44- 1045.42] MTD0010ID: i have no
[ 1045.68- 1047.00] MTD012ME: are the most interesting thing
[ 1048.54- 1050.00] MTD009PM: is it your cat or did you find
[ 1050.00- 1052.84] MTD009PM: on the street
[ 1056.90- 1061.18] MTD0010ID: well it is supposed to be a cat i like cat because
[ 1064.08- 1064.56] MTD0010ID: they are
[ 1067.52- 1068.20] MTD0010ID: independent
[ 1074.90- 1075.24] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1080.76- 1081.08] MTD0010ID: so
[ 1081.60- 1096.80] MTD009PM: ok that is pretty clear so everybody knows how to work the whiteboard now so if you have any ideas or if you want to throw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead it is easy
[ 1088.78- 1089.20] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1100.90- 1110.00] MTD009PM: hey so we have come to the whiteboard so we have got the tool introduction
[ 1102.16- 1102.98] MTD012ME: that would be interesting
[ 1111.24- 1140.00] MTD009PM: moving along to the project finance as you can see we for a remote control a setting price is twenty five euros our setting price our profit aim is fifty million euros that is the least we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to reach our aims we can do it international
[ 1140.00- 1151.44] MTD009PM: so we have to focus on different kind of users different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well but that is all in the later stadium
[ 1152.32- 1170.00] MTD009PM: our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half euros so that is also a point we have to keep in mind that we will not make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that it will not work
[ 1170.00- 1187.68] MTD009PM: so just try to remember these points standard price twenty five of an age fifty million but more important is the in international market we are trying to focus on and production cost maximal twelve and half euros
[ 1189.48- 1200.00] MTD009PM: so that is leads us to our little discussion we have got about five or ten minutes left for discussion so i am going to
[ 1200.00- 1211.18] MTD009PM: it down i think it is easier i have got a message five minutes ok that is a good time let us see
[ 1201.96- 1202.96] MTD012ME: there you go message
[ 1206.96- 1208.02] MTD011UID: five minutes ok
[ 1210.06- 1214.14] MTD012ME: so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
[ 1215.20- 1219.52] MTD009PM: oh maybe you have to say the magic word
[ 1218.62- 1219.90] MTD012ME: yeah right
[ 1221.08- 1222.08] MTD009PM: does it do anything
[ 1222.74- 1223.00] MTD012ME: no
[ 1223.42- 1225.52] MTD009PM: maybe you have to just clap it down and
[ 1228.28- 1229.14] MTD009PM: back up again
[ 1233.96- 1235.96] MTD009PM: the slide share
[ 1236.12- 1236.68] MTD012ME: it is all found
[ 1237.32- 1241.02] MTD009PM: itself right it is really big oh yeah will be ok
[ 1240.52- 1241.56] MTD012ME: well it was
[ 1243.80- 1246.48] MTD009PM: what is those laptops
[ 1247.08- 1247.80] MTD012ME: oh there we are
[ 1248.38- 1260.00] MTD009PM: mance ok but some does everybody has experiences with remote controls and i mean not the ordinary remote controls but also at a
[ 1260.00- 1267.46] MTD009PM: bit different ones like you can use for other no no
[ 1264.36- 1264.74] MTD011UID: oh really
[ 1266.08- 1266.20] MTD011UID: no
[ 1267.46- 1268.20] MTD012ME: well we have a
[ 1267.78- 1268.44] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 1267.80- 1268.38] MTD011UID: yes
[ 1269.10- 1284.42] MTD012ME: kinda broad t v at home and a d v d player so we got like a lot of remote controls one for the t v one for the video recorder one for the d v d player and i think it is it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
[ 1279.04- 1279.58] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1284.68- 1290.00] MTD009PM: yeah yeah i have i have got one at home and you can program i think
[ 1285.04- 1286.42] MTD011UID: true
[ 1290.00- 1318.92] MTD009PM: eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television and everything else and it also operates on infrared so you have got a little device inside your room and then you can operate it from the third or th second floor so that is pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d v d player downstairs and you have got it linked to your t v on the second floor so that is a pretty handy
[ 1294.80- 1296.00] MTD011UID: ok yeah yeah
[ 1306.36- 1307.50] MTD011UID: ok yeah
[ 1308.08- 1308.52] MTD012ME: oh really
[ 1308.88- 1309.18] MTD011UID: oh
[ 1313.88- 1313.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1316.76- 1316.98] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1320.20- 1320.52] MTD009PM: thing
[ 1321.84- 1324.60] MTD009PM: but only the
[ 1325.68- 1334.78] MTD009PM: i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control that makes it a lot easier as well that is
[ 1334.20- 1334.44] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1336.44- 1337.56] MTD009PM: that is good to remember
[ 1337.74- 1339.68] MTD012ME: so i think you can take minutes again
[ 1339.88- 1344.82] MTD009PM: yeah that is nice thank you so we we want different functions
[ 1341.56- 1342.40] MTD012ME: cause it is a very cool
[ 1346.08- 1346.32] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1346.76- 1350.00] MTD009PM: and we can
[ 1350.00- 1360.20] MTD009PM: maybe see if we can do something with infrared but i do not know if that will exceed the production costs that will that is something we have to find out i think
[ 1360.50- 1364.78] MTD012ME: yeah but that would be really good if we could do that
[ 1365.92- 1368.92] MTD009PM: other functions for a remote control
[ 1370.40- 1373.28] MTD009PM: maybe we can make it yeah
[ 1374.24- 1375.34] MTD012ME: think it has to be shock proof
[ 1376.04- 1376.72] MTD011UID: sure yeah
[ 1376.62- 1376.88] MTD012ME: cause
[ 1377.24- 1378.06] MTD009PM: sharp proof
[ 1378.40- 1380.00] MTD012ME: my remote control tends to
[ 1379.76- 1380.00] MTD011UID: for our
[ 1380.00- 1380.84] MTD011UID: proves or
[ 1380.00- 1380.44] MTD012ME: all that
[ 1381.86- 1382.14] MTD012ME: so
[ 1382.18- 1384.92] MTD011UID: yeah you never know like i mean
[ 1382.44- 1382.74] MTD009PM: yep
[ 1386.88- 1387.64] MTD009PM: waterproof
[ 1389.76- 1400.30] MTD009PM: ok so these are a few things we can think of i will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder
[ 1401.32- 1401.52] MTD011UID: kay
[ 1401.48- 1407.64] MTD012ME: yeah i had one other little thing i thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
[ 1408.74- 1409.40] MTD012ME: so i can see
[ 1408.78- 1410.00] MTD009PM: that is battery
[ 1410.00- 1410.40] MTD009PM: status
[ 1410.36- 1411.24] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1410.84- 1412.12] MTD012ME: how much is left in the battery
[ 1414.32- 1419.94] MTD012ME: but it will also really drag up the production costs so i think we will have to see about that too
[ 1418.64- 1418.94] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1421.56- 1421.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1422.16- 1424.36] MTD012ME: but maybe just a little lag i dunno
[ 1425.62- 1427.92] MTD009PM: that is an idea as well other ideas
[ 1429.28- 1429.88] MTD009PM: quick ideas
[ 1430.42- 1432.48] MTD0010ID: no they were all mentioned so
[ 1432.48- 1437.92] MTD009PM: ok any questions about this presentation kick off presentation
[ 1440.82- 1441.80] MTD012ME: no i think so
[ 1442.44- 1442.62] MTD009PM: no
[ 1443.76- 1447.90] MTD009PM: ok then i will put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
[ 1449.34- 1450.48] MTD009PM: and then we can all work
[ 1451.74- 1459.56] MTD009PM: finish meeting now ok and we can all work on our own projects
[ 1453.72- 1454.08] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1455.28- 1455.82] MTD012ME: so
[ 1468.18- 1470.00] MTD009PM: ok then i will meet you
[ 1470.00- 1476.40] MTD009PM: in about a half an hour i think
[ 1472.02- 1472.50] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1474.04- 1474.30] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 1474.20- 1475.54] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1474.28- 1475.26] MTD012ME: ok

[   57.12-   60.00] MTD009PM: ok everybody found this place again
[   60.00-   71.00] MTD009PM: yeah that is nice ok so this is our second meeting and still failing
[   60.56-   60.96] MTD012ME: s
[   71.80-   72.12] MTD012ME: yeah
[   72.76-   90.00] MTD009PM: and now we are going into the functional design important thing of this phase is that we are going to try to get a agreement about the user requirements technical function
[   90.00-   92.44] MTD009PM: design and the working design
[   93.12-  107.74] MTD009PM: so that we can move on to the second phase but first this phase first announcement there is a little adaptation in the air conditioning system so
[  109.66-  119.96] MTD009PM: there is our ghost mouse again that that means that you can have a little trouble a little trouble with air conditioning that is because of this
[  120.38-  120.74] MTD011UID: ok
[  121.10-  121.48] MTD012ME: ok
[  121.56-  139.12] MTD009PM: and it is in wings c and e so it should be over in in a couple of days it is going to be cold anyway so i do not think we are going to do it then our agenda yeah first the opening this time i will take the minutes
[  132.84-  133.18] MTD012ME: no
[  140.36-  150.00] MTD009PM: you are going to have a presentation all of you and we have got forty minutes for the whole president
[  150.00-  163.54] MTD009PM: through presentations so i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me
[  164.38-  180.00] MTD009PM: and then the decision on the control functions which we want to include and those which we both want to include i have got forty minutes for all of it so i suggest let us start at the first presentation
[  178.78-  179.08] MTD012ME: yes
[  180.00-  181.34] MTD009PM: who wants to be first
[  182.76-  183.56] MTD012ME: i think i will go first
[  183.74-  186.08] MTD009PM: ok so
[  187.94-  197.88] MTD009PM: so maybe it is easy if you yeah i think you will tell them your presentation as well just which function you have and what you going to talk about
[  206.60-  210.00] MTD012ME: kay my name is frik from polen i am market expert
[  210.00-  210.92] MTD012ME: you already knew that
[  212.10-  228.22] MTD012ME: i have done some research we have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls we let them fill out a questionnaire we had one hundred of these test subjects
[  229.36-  236.64] MTD012ME: in addition we did some market research see what the market consists of what ages are involved
[  238.90-  240.00] MTD012ME: well these are three
[  240.00-  249.64] MTD012ME: three quite astonishing results i thought remotes are being considered ugly fi seventy five percent of the
[  250.96-  263.20] MTD012ME: people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly and an additional eighty percent indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control so
[  264.68-  270.00] MTD012ME: and in addition remotes were not very functional fifty percent of the people indicated they only
[  270.00-  273.32] MTD012ME: luke used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
[  275.08-  279.40] MTD012ME: and fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room
[  280.48-  280.80] MTD012ME: so
[  281.84-  282.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[  282.32-  283.08] MTD012ME: some things
[  285.34-  300.00] MTD012ME: then we did some research to do the most relevant functions channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power button got a nine and teletext got a
[  300.00-  302.22] MTD012ME: six and a half so these are the most
[  303.36-  320.74] MTD012ME: most important functions of a remote control and then there are some one time use function that is what i like to call them they are the audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
[  322.10-  329.44] MTD012ME: channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
[  332.14-  341.16] MTD012ME: then these are the this is the market sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six
[  344.14-  356.72] MTD012ME: the main characteristic of this group is that they are very critical on the remote control and they like to use new f new functions but they also are very critical they will not spend their money very easily so
[  357.86-  360.00] MTD012ME: the users of forty six
[  360.00-  364.24] MTD012ME: sixty five years consi they make up forty percent of the market
[  365.24-  369.96] MTD012ME: they are not really very interested in features but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
[  375.36-  378.12] MTD012ME: well i think this indicates for our
[  379.44-  384.80] MTD012ME: design i think we should make a remote for the future and this means we would
[  386.00-  389.84] MTD012ME: have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five
[  390.82-  399.38] MTD012ME: this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that would also be where our main profit would be gettable
[  400.48-  403.42] MTD012ME: this would mean we would have to make a fancy design
[  406.60-  416.14] MTD012ME: the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r s r s i
[  417.56-  420.00] MTD012ME: this is certainly something to
[  420.00-  436.72] MTD012ME: take into account and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn an how to operate a new control remote control so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design decides of course that the remote must look very nice
[  438.08-  439.12] MTD012ME: functionality
[  440.40-  450.00] MTD012ME: as a lot of people indicate that they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons this will also be beneficial to
[  450.00-  451.76] MTD012ME: the design of the remote
[  453.28-  466.96] MTD012ME: i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons because they are used most and so they should be robust they should not break down easily
[  471.64-  478.52] MTD012ME: then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room it might be
[  479.62-  480.00] MTD012ME: and i say
[  480.00-  496.28] MTD012ME: might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot but it might be a good idea to make a docking station and this would could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep
[  496.56-  503.92] MTD012ME: so you would know where it is in the room and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
[  505.72-  510.00] MTD012ME: then a surprisingly great deal of people
[  510.00-  518.26] MTD012ME: would indicate it that an l c d screen in the remote control would be preferred this was
[  519.58-  535.74] MTD012ME: mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five but up till forty five it remains feasible this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could s consider
[  538.04-  538.34] MTD009PM: ok
[  538.60-  539.24] MTD012ME: that would be all
[  540.00-  545.16] MTD009PM: thank you so anybody have any questions until now
[  544.20-  544.90] MTD012ME: any questions
[  546.16-  546.78] MTD011UID: no
[  546.24-  549.06] MTD009PM: not function requirements ok that is clear
[  550.32-  550.52] MTD012ME: ok
[  550.66-  551.60] MTD009PM: and to the second
[  560.28-  570.00] MTD011UID: ok i have to look at the user interface of it f for the techno for
[  567.52-  567.66] MTD009PM: yep
[  570.00-  572.20] MTD011UID: functions of of it
[  574.62-  578.48] MTD009PM: yeah you can take your time we got the plenty of time so
[  574.96-  575.44] MTD011UID: oh
[  577.42-  581.88] MTD012ME: yeah you should get the top pinging slideshow alright
[  578.92-  580.52] MTD011UID: oh yeah
[  581.58-  583.36] MTD009PM: yep good it is
[  581.64-  581.92] MTD011UID: ok
[  584.44-  600.00] MTD011UID: yeah i think we must use the general functions of the remote control i have thin i have doing a l little research on the internet
[  600.00-  609.32] MTD011UID: and we have not much information about it so about the interface but
[  611.58-  629.44] MTD011UID: yeah i have been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one in one remote control so you have got a lot of div devices like d v d television stereo so
[  630.00-  646.40] MTD011UID: but it must be user friendly so yeah you c you can not put a lot of functions in one yeah in w yeah in one remote control but
[  645.36-  646.38] MTD009PM: on
[  648.56-  648.94] MTD011UID: yeah
[  651.28-  660.00] MTD011UID: yeah got many functions in one remote control but
[  660.00-  663.18] MTD011UID: you can see this is f quite simple remote control
[  663.54-  674.82] MTD011UID: few buttons but this remo remote control got a lot of buttons yeah people do not like it so
[  676.08-  690.00] MTD011UID: what i was thinking about was keep the general functions like the yards like the on off button keep it yeah l like a red button
[  690.00-  696.88] MTD011UID: everybody everybody knows it so you do not have to change that
[  699.04-  707.88] MTD011UID: personal preferences use a display for specific functions of the different devices so
[  708.96-  714.68] MTD011UID: what i was thin thinking about was you got
[  725.52-  741.44] MTD011UID: this the remote control and you got here the general functions like the on off button sound i do not know and here you got a s kind of a display
[  742.76-  750.00] MTD011UID: this is a touch screen so yeah you got the general f of the functions of the device for your d v d
[  750.00-  764.52] MTD011UID: player or so a play yeah for playing reverse so so and we got here real buttons for selecting a device
[  765.86-  780.00] MTD011UID: so this button is for d v or yeah so for every device you got a f a pa apart displays of apart buttons
[  780.00-  793.20] MTD011UID: buttons so you have you never got all the buttons on one device so that is my idea about it yeah and
[  786.48-  787.64] MTD009PM: ok
[  790.16-  790.44] MTD009PM: ok
[  794.56-  810.00] MTD011UID: let us see yeah so touch screen and the b the buttons the real buttons we have to use we better ca use quite large buttons for yeah
[  810.00-  812.62] MTD011UID: everybody have to use it so
[  813.04-  825.48] MTD011UID: old even of old people or young people so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large so
[  823.58-  823.86] MTD009PM: yeah
[  826.98-  828.96] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[  830.42-  832.68] MTD011UID: that was my part of it so
[  831.72-  836.10] MTD009PM: ok you want to ask questions about the technical functions
[  836.32-  840.00] MTD0010ID: well i think if we are going to use a touch screen we are going to go
[  840.00-  842.32] MTD0010ID: way above twelve and a half euros
[  842.50-  856.48] MTD011UID: yeah i i do not think so you got quite cheap touch screens it is not in color or something it is just one color yeah
[  842.62-  842.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[  847.04-  847.52] MTD009PM: touch screen
[  857.68-  869.60] MTD011UID: i have seen something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago you got yeah quite an
[  871.44-  876.84] MTD011UID: a kind of touch screen it is for
[  878.16-  885.16] MTD011UID: twenty euros or less so it is possible
[  882.60-  883.14] MTD009PM: right
[  884.94-  887.00] MTD009PM: yeah that is nice
[  886.28-  888.38] MTD012ME: well we would certainly make a fancy design
[  888.56-  888.78] MTD011UID: yeah
[  889.60-  890.00] MTD009PM: yeah
[  889.68-  895.32] MTD0010ID: yeah so the it would not be very robust it is very fragile and you can get scratches on it
[  889.90-  890.50] MTD012ME: so the
[  895.44-  896.06] MTD012ME: that is true
[  896.04-  900.00] MTD009PM: that is right yeah maybe you can first this
[  896.62-  897.60] MTD011UID: yeah that is true that is true
[  897.08-  898.20] MTD012ME: we will have to look into that
[  900.00-  906.68] MTD009PM: to your presentation and then we will have a little discussion about the requirements in the design
[  901.60-  902.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[  901.66-  901.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[  901.68-  902.16] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  904.92-  905.32] MTD0010ID: ok
[  920.00-  923.84] MTD009PM: i think it is going to no it is not going to
[  923.72-  930.00] MTD0010ID: ok i have got a presentation about the working design first about how it works
[  930.00-  943.00] MTD0010ID: it is really simple of course everybody knows how a remote works the user presses a button the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the t v the t v switches to the frequency or th what function it is
[  944.22-  959.82] MTD0010ID: so you have got the plate it has got conductive disks for every button when the user presses a button a signal got sent goes to the lab and transmitted transmit transmits it to the t v
[  960.00-  983.24] MTD0010ID: it is a very simple device technical speed so this is a schematic overview you have got the buttons the power source and when a button gets pressed it goes to the chip the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb when you press a button you can actually see you pressed button
[  985.58-  990.00] MTD0010ID: well i think we should use default materials simple plug
[  990.00- 1003.00] MTD0010ID: lastics keep the inner working simple so it is robust i think we should focus on esthetics the design and the user interface because if you are going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
[ 1004.88- 1011.04] MTD0010ID: and you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product
[ 1012.08- 1020.00] MTD0010ID: so it is in my idea it is it is going to be smart to invest in dis in design and not in in the product
[ 1020.00- 1020.44] MTD0010ID: so
[ 1021.92- 1022.50] MTD0010ID: that is it
[ 1023.16- 1024.00] MTD009PM: ok thank you
[ 1031.06- 1031.56] MTD009PM: ok
[ 1038.36- 1039.32] MTD009PM: oh
[ 1041.76- 1050.00] MTD009PM: ok now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now
[ 1050.00- 1057.24] MTD009PM: i am the project manager so i am here to mess the things up and tell you some new requirements
[ 1058.24- 1078.28] MTD009PM: that is we have got to design a remote which is only suitable for t v that is because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions
[ 1068.80- 1069.16] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1078.78- 1080.00] MTD009PM: so it has to be simple
[ 1080.00- 1100.68] MTD009PM: another point is we have to skip the teletext because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past and it is a function we do not need in our remote control
[ 1101.84- 1110.00] MTD009PM: internet is also mentioned just ago in a function we can use maybe also on televisions it will be available
[ 1110.00- 1110.64] MTD009PM: well
[ 1111.84- 1125.76] MTD009PM: another one is the customer is forty plus that is the the market we have to to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
[ 1126.66- 1140.00] MTD009PM: and this is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the the younger persons so we have to find a market which is above forty plus
[ 1140.00- 1142.00] MTD009PM: but which will suit our
[ 1143.04- 1167.20] MTD009PM: remote control and the other way around and we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works and we have to be very clear on this point as well so i suggest
[ 1168.78- 1170.00] MTD009PM: let us have a
[ 1170.00- 1172.16] MTD009PM: discussion on the control functions
[ 1173.66- 1174.00] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1174.94- 1177.96] MTD012ME: so is there any discussion possible about the new project requirements
[ 1178.98- 1189.88] MTD009PM: we can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product
[ 1189.34- 1200.00] MTD012ME: yeah cause you are you are saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it is not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon and new t v s will
[ 1200.00- 1208.64] MTD012ME: have internet access on them but i think if you are targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a t v with internet access
[ 1209.76- 1212.78] MTD012ME: within the next like twenty years is very slim
[ 1214.14- 1225.44] MTD012ME: in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control so i think it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it
[ 1214.20- 1214.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1227.36- 1228.40] MTD012ME: i am pretty much against it
[ 1229.56- 1230.00] MTD009PM: against the
[ 1230.00- 1230.92] MTD009PM: no teletext
[ 1230.08- 1230.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1230.96- 1232.68] MTD012ME: yes
[ 1235.32- 1238.78] MTD012ME: besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
[ 1239.84- 1240.64] MTD012ME: pretty small
[ 1243.20- 1248.72] MTD012ME: but i mean if i s if i see this it i think we are just going to go for another
[ 1244.22- 1245.28] MTD009PM: yeah it is it is
[ 1245.20- 1245.62] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1249.58- 1251.08] MTD009PM: step remote
[ 1250.42- 1250.84] MTD012ME: pretty
[ 1252.40- 1253.84] MTD009PM: no i think we can
[ 1252.92- 1254.40] MTD012ME: in not innovative
[ 1255.52- 1260.00] MTD009PM: i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple
[ 1255.64- 1256.38] MTD012ME: remote control
[ 1260.00- 1275.76] MTD009PM: buttons which are also mentioned if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons or just a remote which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is forty percent of the market
[ 1273.56- 1274.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1276.60- 1289.96] MTD009PM: and if you look in holland the whole generation of forty plus fifty plus it it is the the biggest share of the of the whole population now
[ 1291.04- 1292.98] MTD012ME: yes but it is not the biggest part of the
[ 1294.20- 1294.56] MTD012ME: market
[ 1295.48- 1295.84] MTD009PM: no
[ 1295.58- 1299.72] MTD012ME: and besides that they are not very critical so i mean they do not really care
[ 1300.70- 1306.88] MTD012ME: what the remote control is like they will just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
[ 1308.72- 1320.00] MTD009PM: but do not you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market that people think from the people think that is the
[ 1320.00- 1326.04] MTD009PM: the device i have looked for although i did not realize it so let us try it
[ 1326.96- 1327.22] MTD012ME: no
[ 1328.22- 1329.60] MTD012ME: i think that would be the case in the
[ 1331.00- 1334.14] MTD012ME: sixteen to forty five ages category
[ 1336.26- 1340.76] MTD012ME: because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control
[ 1341.96- 1346.04] MTD012ME: people of forty plus i mean they want it to work but
[ 1347.52- 1349.76] MTD012ME: as sol as soon as it works it is ok with them
[ 1351.64- 1352.06] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1352.76- 1362.80] MTD0010ID: i think that if we are p if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i do not know if you have heard about it in the news the the elderly mobile phone
[ 1353.20- 1353.56] MTD012ME: so
[ 1362.98- 1364.48] MTD009PM: yeah it is a big success
[ 1364.66- 1379.40] MTD0010ID: yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind we could make tons of money i think we do not have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality we just
[ 1365.08- 1366.10] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1365.52- 1367.68] MTD009PM: make a remote control yeah
[ 1371.92- 1372.16] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1371.96- 1373.68] MTD009PM: yeah it is
[ 1380.68- 1383.46] MTD0010ID: change our focus on the project and i think
[ 1385.00- 1386.36] MTD0010ID: we can we can sell this
[ 1387.22- 1390.12] MTD009PM: i simply think
[ 1393.12- 1407.26] MTD009PM: that the new products we are going to make spec simply design are designed for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people
[ 1408.60- 1410.00] MTD009PM: and
[ 1410.00- 1430.36] MTD009PM: i think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls cause what you told is the channel selection is important volume selection power and teletext ok
[ 1423.96- 1424.26] MTD012ME: yes
[ 1427.46- 1427.88] MTD012ME: yes
[ 1428.60- 1428.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1430.36- 1432.76] MTD012ME: but obviously the board tends to disagree
[ 1433.24- 1440.00] MTD009PM: no we we have not voted yet so i think teletext can be
[ 1441.96- 1447.76] MTD009PM: can be a function as well but only if if it will not
[ 1448.72- 1457.04] MTD009PM: hire the the cost cause i do not know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well but i do not think that will be a problem
[ 1458.56- 1460.04] MTD009PM: for is teletext
[ 1459.04- 1465.06] MTD011UID: dev people need teletext for for subtitle so it is yeah
[ 1463.24- 1463.56] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1463.52- 1464.44] MTD012ME: that also
[ 1465.48- 1467.40] MTD009PM: yeah so i suggest
[ 1466.64- 1469.72] MTD012ME: i think it would definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext
[ 1467.48- 1467.84] MTD011UID: it is
[ 1469.04- 1469.34] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1469.08- 1469.44] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1470.56- 1473.74] MTD009PM: is anybody really against teletext
[ 1474.40- 1474.64] MTD0010ID: no
[ 1475.00- 1479.56] MTD009PM: just that that we just keep the teletext
[ 1481.68- 1484.76] MTD009PM: i think that is a good idea as well especially for the subtitles
[ 1486.80- 1487.86] MTD009PM: maybe we can
[ 1489.48- 1491.24] MTD009PM: make that
[ 1493.46- 1500.00] MTD009PM: another point of advantage in our remote control if we make a c a
[ 1500.00- 1511.72] MTD009PM: buttons for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think oh i want to have subtitles and they push the button and they get the big subtitles
[ 1505.84- 1506.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1512.20- 1513.30] MTD0010ID: yeah that is a good idea
[ 1512.44- 1513.76] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 1514.02- 1521.64] MTD009PM: so i think data text can view can be very useful in our advantage
[ 1523.24- 1526.16] MTD009PM: functionality should be few buttons you said
[ 1527.62- 1528.00] MTD012ME: yes
[ 1528.28- 1530.00] MTD009PM: i think
[ 1528.52- 1528.64] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1530.00- 1532.40] MTD009PM: that is very important we have a few buttons
[ 1535.32- 1537.00] MTD009PM: so to keep it simple
[ 1535.96- 1536.24] MTD012ME: but
[ 1537.94- 1540.20] MTD012ME: i do not think that is really an issue anymore cause
[ 1541.64- 1542.64] MTD012ME: well might be
[ 1543.92- 1546.16] MTD011UID: if it is only for a tele yeah
[ 1544.16- 1553.28] MTD012ME: but i mean if if it is only for t v you are not going to need a lot of buttons anyway you need the one to zero button next channel previous channel
[ 1547.16- 1547.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1548.68- 1549.12] MTD009PM: no
[ 1551.76- 1552.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1554.40- 1557.94] MTD012ME: volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
[ 1559.52- 1559.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1562.00- 1562.68] MTD009PM: but do you need
[ 1562.12- 1563.60] MTD012ME: i think if you if you only
[ 1562.52- 1567.12] MTD011UID: so we can not we can not skip the display so we do not need that
[ 1566.54- 1573.34] MTD009PM: but do you need the buttons for one two zero maybe pick it in a
[ 1567.40- 1568.12] MTD012ME: no
[ 1572.58- 1585.06] MTD012ME: think if you are going to include teletext you do i think many people like to use that because you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you do not want to push the next channel button thirty five times
[ 1577.12- 1579.04] MTD009PM: maybe we can use
[ 1577.64- 1577.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1584.22- 1584.40] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1584.92- 1587.96] MTD009PM: yeah maybe we can implement a scroll button
[ 1590.00- 1591.54] MTD009PM: or a joystick like
[ 1593.04- 1601.48] MTD009PM: there are other ways to just look if you look at telephones the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
[ 1595.72- 1596.12] MTD011UID: yes
[ 1597.72- 1598.10] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1600.08- 1600.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1603.26- 1605.24] MTD012ME: that is true but
[ 1607.00- 1612.38] MTD012ME: i do not think there are many t v s that can switch channels that fast and so you would need like
[ 1613.64- 1619.00] MTD012ME: the t v would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
[ 1620.24- 1622.20] MTD012ME: and i do not know if many channels would
[ 1624.20- 1626.12] MTD012ME: do have that many t v s and
[ 1626.06- 1638.60] MTD0010ID: yeah and besides that it is if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt they are not used to using scroll buttons so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout
[ 1626.84- 1627.24] MTD011UID: yes
[ 1635.36- 1635.90] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 1640.74- 1650.00] MTD009PM: the numbers the yeah we can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display and if it is too much we can reconsider it
[ 1650.00- 1654.92] MTD009PM: but i think there will not be very much buttons or there do not have to be
[ 1651.32- 1651.64] MTD011UID: oh
[ 1654.00- 1660.64] MTD012ME: but i do not think i think if you are going to make a remote control only to operate a t v you there is not much you can gain on
[ 1661.68- 1675.40] MTD012ME: having as few buttons as possible cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t v which already only have the minimum number of buttons i do not think there is much to be gained in that area
[ 1676.18- 1680.00] MTD009PM: the number of buttons i think it is very important in the
[ 1676.20- 1676.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1677.80- 1678.04] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1680.00- 1680.82] MTD009PM: in the design
[ 1681.92- 1690.18] MTD009PM: you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with it
[ 1691.60- 1700.00] MTD012ME: that is true but i think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you are making a remote control only for to operate only the t v
[ 1701.66- 1703.40] MTD009PM: to operate only the t v yeah
[ 1702.16- 1708.96] MTD012ME: cause if you have a remote control only to operate a t v there is simply not a lot of buttons required
[ 1710.06- 1715.52] MTD012ME: there is not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply do not have a lot of buttons either
[ 1715.80- 1716.12] MTD009PM: no
[ 1717.28- 1717.92] MTD009PM: so
[ 1717.66- 1721.84] MTD012ME: so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
[ 1722.52- 1723.76] MTD009PM: kay so we can
[ 1723.04- 1726.02] MTD012ME: that would that would cost a big marketing
[ 1728.16- 1728.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1728.16- 1728.84] MTD012ME: expedition
[ 1729.82- 1730.32] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 1730.40- 1730.98] MTD012ME: which was
[ 1731.96- 1736.64] MTD012ME: one of the arguments to make it only for the t v because we did not have the time to market a lot
[ 1737.00- 1740.00] MTD009PM: yeah so you suggest we could better
[ 1740.00- 1744.34] MTD009PM: focus on for example the docking station
[ 1745.70- 1747.16] MTD009PM: like other functions
[ 1749.60- 1752.10] MTD009PM: instead of a few of less buttons
[ 1749.74- 1750.34] MTD012ME: maybe
[ 1752.80- 1753.08] MTD012ME: well
[ 1754.12- 1758.36] MTD012ME: yeah i think i mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
[ 1759.40- 1761.52] MTD012ME: but i do not think we should spend very much time in that
[ 1762.38- 1766.72] MTD009PM: no you think the docking station will
[ 1767.88- 1770.00] MTD009PM: i is allowed in the
[ 1770.00- 1771.16] MTD009PM: budget we have
[ 1772.60- 1779.12] MTD0010ID: it should be possible yes if it is not too fancy and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible
[ 1774.04- 1774.92] MTD009PM: cause i think
[ 1774.34- 1775.08] MTD011UID: right
[ 1776.20- 1776.60] MTD009PM: no
[ 1779.00- 1781.48] MTD009PM: yeah cause i think that is
[ 1779.40- 1779.56] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1782.56- 1793.64] MTD009PM: that is a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking docking station or a very so that that is a nice requirement
[ 1785.68- 1786.12] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 1794.84- 1795.80] MTD009PM: docking station
[ 1797.00- 1799.02] MTD0010ID: so we are just going to focus on the extras
[ 1800.46- 1801.12] MTD009PM: i think so
[ 1801.24- 1801.42] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1801.92- 1804.28] MTD012ME: yeah i think maybe we should do some research on to
[ 1805.32- 1807.32] MTD012ME: what elderly people like to have in a
[ 1808.24- 1808.64] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1808.50- 1810.40] MTD012ME: like to have x ray in a remote control
[ 1811.16- 1813.84] MTD009PM: that is a good point
[ 1816.42- 1818.68] MTD009PM: you said they easily get lost as well
[ 1820.00- 1824.44] MTD012ME: yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control tended to get lost
[ 1822.92- 1823.22] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1824.56- 1829.40] MTD009PM: so maybe we should implement the audio sign or something
[ 1829.64- 1830.00] MTD012ME: yeah there
[ 1830.00- 1842.52] MTD012ME: as well i suggested you have it on yeah yeah you have it some some phones too which you have a docking station and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
[ 1831.04- 1831.46] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1831.58- 1835.48] MTD0010ID: like with your key chain if you whistle it goes it makes a sound
[ 1832.88- 1833.48] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1834.40- 1834.72] MTD011UID: yes
[ 1839.12- 1839.36] MTD0010ID: right
[ 1842.68- 1852.80] MTD009PM: yeah so audio signal should be possible as well i think it is not too expensive another
[ 1843.28- 1844.04] MTD012ME: so you know where it is
[ 1848.32- 1848.84] MTD011UID: oh
[ 1854.30- 1856.92] MTD009PM: point is the l c d screen
[ 1860.00- 1865.76] MTD009PM: i do not know if that will raise the cost too much
[ 1865.24- 1869.74] MTD0010ID: yeah i think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen cause
[ 1870.82- 1872.92] MTD009PM: yeah sometimes it will be too much yeah
[ 1871.20- 1871.80] MTD0010ID: i think
[ 1871.50- 1871.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1873.16- 1890.00] MTD012ME: i think since a lot of people indicated a new remote control was hard to learn and we are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it which would tell
[ 1890.00- 1890.68] MTD012ME: you what it does
[ 1892.20- 1892.48] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1893.12- 1897.30] MTD012ME: and it would not have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen but
[ 1895.66- 1896.10] MTD009PM: i think
[ 1895.96- 1897.56] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1898.96- 1901.70] MTD009PM: just the l c d or just a normal screen
[ 1902.38- 1904.38] MTD012ME: just a small screen and two
[ 1903.16- 1907.42] MTD009PM: it is a good idea some extra info feedback
[ 1906.96- 1907.36] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1908.98- 1910.60] MTD009PM: yeah i think that is a good idea as well
[ 1909.00- 1909.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1911.52- 1913.08] MTD012ME: but i do not know if that would
[ 1914.64- 1915.84] MTD009PM: it is the small screen
[ 1915.20- 1916.36] MTD012ME: that would fit into the
[ 1919.72- 1920.00] MTD012ME: cost
[ 1920.00- 1920.28] MTD012ME: s
[ 1924.28- 1925.80] MTD009PM: extra button info
[ 1929.40- 1950.00] MTD009PM: i think that should be possible as well let us see what did we say more should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn few buttons we talked about that talking station l c d general function
[ 1950.00- 1950.72] MTD009PM: tions
[ 1952.50- 1953.16] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1956.04- 1956.46] MTD009PM: kay
[ 1960.36- 1962.80] MTD009PM: and default materials
[ 1964.52- 1979.44] MTD009PM: i think that is a good idea as well because all the people do not mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one so it does not really matter so i think
[ 1975.20- 1975.80] MTD012ME: no
[ 1979.00- 1980.00] MTD012ME: i think probably
[ 1980.00- 1984.36] MTD012ME: elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and
[ 1985.52- 1986.10] MTD012ME: youngsters
[ 1988.80- 2006.88] MTD009PM: let us specify the target group but are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty because i think what we are going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
[ 2009.08- 2009.70] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2009.36- 2009.54] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2010.44- 2019.24] MTD009PM: what do we want if we want to profilators with for example the the telephone for elderly people we can
[ 2011.08- 2011.56] MTD012ME: i think
[ 2020.52- 2022.52] MTD009PM: target the real elderly people
[ 2024.28- 2031.98] MTD012ME: i think that would be if we should do something like that it would be r i think it would be really good for for the image of the company
[ 2033.24- 2033.52] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2033.80- 2036.80] MTD012ME: and i think i think there would be good market for it
[ 2038.00- 2038.94] MTD009PM: so that is the
[ 2038.50- 2040.00] MTD012ME: if we are able to
[ 2040.00- 2042.10] MTD012ME: really bring an innovative product
[ 2042.48- 2045.36] MTD009PM: and you are talking about sixty to eighty for example
[ 2045.10- 2046.26] MTD012ME: yeah to really
[ 2046.80- 2049.40] MTD009PM: yeah sixty
[ 2048.30- 2048.56] MTD012ME: but
[ 2050.42- 2051.96] MTD012ME: i have to look into that a little more
[ 2052.34- 2056.92] MTD009PM: ok and different cultures are we
[ 2057.40- 2060.94] MTD0010ID: well i do not think they have different television sets
[ 2062.02- 2062.56] MTD011UID: ok
[ 2062.20- 2062.74] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2062.34- 2063.44] MTD0010ID: in in every country
[ 2064.20- 2064.62] MTD009PM: no
[ 2064.80- 2065.16] MTD011UID: no
[ 2065.48- 2065.80] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 2067.60- 2070.00] MTD009PM: we have got five minutes left so is this not
[ 2068.44- 2070.00] MTD011UID: so i think
[ 2069.68- 2070.00] MTD012ME: ok
[ 2070.00- 2070.94] MTD009PM: so
[ 2070.00- 2077.96] MTD012ME: sort of w and with the the little screen in it with it which explains the buttons you could i think we it would be a lot easier to
[ 2075.16- 2075.48] MTD009PM: so you could
[ 2078.96- 2081.12] MTD012ME: adapt it to different cultures
[ 2081.64- 2083.96] MTD009PM: yeah in different languages yeah
[ 2083.18- 2083.48] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2083.36- 2083.66] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 2085.22- 2100.00] MTD009PM: or you have to put a language button in it but that will be a bit unnecessary i think it is better to put it on different markets with you know ok so that is the target then
[ 2086.12- 2086.48] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2089.04- 2090.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2090.24- 2090.56] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2093.64- 2094.06] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2094.56- 2094.82] MTD0010ID: yep
[ 2100.00- 2103.24] MTD009PM: a few small things
[ 2105.96- 2124.32] MTD009PM: ok i will put the minutes in the project project document folder what we are going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept the user interface designer they use the interface concept and the trend watching
[ 2124.58- 2130.00] MTD009PM: so just keep in mind the things we have said about the target group i do not put now a
[ 2130.00- 2139.56] MTD009PM: requirements and the trends which you are going on and the specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
[ 2140.44- 2140.62] MTD012ME: kay
[ 2140.80- 2146.56] MTD009PM: so i thank you for this meeting and i think we have a lunch break now
[ 2147.12- 2147.76] MTD012ME: that is good
[ 2147.68- 2147.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2147.94- 2149.36] MTD009PM: so that is a good thing
[ 2168.32- 2169.96] MTD0010ID: now we are not not allowed to talk about it
[ 2168.32- 2169.96] MTD009PM: now we are not not allowed to talk about it
[ 2168.32- 2169.96] MTD011UID: now we are not not allowed to talk about it
[ 2168.32- 2169.96] MTD012ME: now we are not not allowed to talk about it
[ 2171.88- 2173.00] MTD0010ID: that is going to be very angry
[ 2171.88- 2173.00] MTD009PM: that is going to be very angry
[ 2171.88- 2173.00] MTD011UID: that is going to be very angry
[ 2171.88- 2173.00] MTD012ME: that is going to be very angry

[    7.68-    8.84] MTD0010ID: just received an l b
[    7.68-    8.84] MTD011UID: just received an l b
[   21.26-   30.00] MTD009PM: ok good afternoon this is our third meeting already i hope you enjoyed your lunch
[   24.08-   24.64] MTD012ME: good afternoon
[   30.00-   36.02] MTD009PM: edit all right let us see
[   39.62-   60.00] MTD009PM: presentation three ok this is the second phase we are going to discuss today at the conceptual design meeting and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification
[   60.00-   60.96] MTD009PM: of components
[   61.24-   75.80] MTD009PM: conceptual specification of design and also trend watching these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pr presentations you are going to show me in a few minutes
[   77.08-   90.00] MTD009PM: but first i will show you the agenda first the opening then we have three presentations after that we have to come to a decision on the remote control
[   90.00-   98.00] MTD009PM: our concepts how we are going to make it and then we are closing you have about forty minutes
[   99.12-  107.48] MTD009PM: so i suggest let us get started did someone encounter any problems during the operation
[  109.64-  112.56] MTD009PM: no everything fine it says
[  109.74-  109.96] MTD011UID: no
[  114.80-  120.00] MTD009PM: then a little thing about
[  120.00-  139.88] MTD009PM: the last meeting these are the points we agreed on the requirements and the target market requirements are teletext talking station audio signal small screen with some extra te button information and we are going to use default materials
[  141.36-  150.00] MTD009PM: does somebody have any comments on these requirements maybe no these are just the
[  150.00-  157.56] MTD009PM: things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know and maybe we can work it out
[  158.44-  163.34] MTD009PM: and we are going to target the sixty to to eighty year old customers
[  165.12-  174.02] MTD009PM: so now everybody knows what you know what we are doing and i suggest let us get started with the presentations
[  175.32-  180.00] MTD009PM: so we keep the same lined up as last time
[  180.26-  183.00] MTD012ME: sure i will start off then
[  180.88-  181.24] MTD009PM: ok
[  182.68-  184.52] MTD009PM: ok
[  192.76-  193.34] MTD012ME: t
[  203.96-  210.00] MTD012ME: ok i am going to inform you about the trend watching everybody over the past few days
[  210.00-  216.10] MTD012ME: we have done some market research we distributed some more enquetes questionnaires
[  216.70-  235.24] MTD012ME: and besides that i deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to well get a hold of the newest trends and i have consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
[  236.86-  240.00] MTD012ME: the best design would be
[  240.00-  254.62] MTD012ME: ok these are some overall findings most important thing is the fancy design the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor
[  255.10-  267.76] MTD012ME: innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls
[  268.96-  270.00] MTD012ME: about
[  270.00-  291.92] MTD012ME: half of half as important as the innovativeness was was easy to use for our group we are focusing on the people of sixty eighty ye years old this is these factors are slightly more equal
[  295.08-  300.00] MTD012ME: ok these are some more group specific findings the older people prefer dark colors
[  300.00-  310.92] MTD012ME: olors they like recognizable shapes and familiar material and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
[  312.00-  327.64] MTD012ME: the material for older people this is this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that a remote should have
[  331.06-  339.34] MTD012ME: this leads us to some personal preferences the remote control and the docking station should blend in in the
[  340.44-  360.00] MTD012ME: in the room so this would mean no eye catching designs just keep it simple and well the docking station and the small screen would be our main points of interest because this would be the these would be the
[  360.00-  362.70] MTD012ME: innovativeness in the remote control
[  363.92-  384.68] MTD012ME: so this would be very important that we at least include these features well the trend watchers i consulted advised that it should be the remote control on the docking station should be telephone shape so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station
[  385.50-  390.00] MTD012ME: this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to
[  390.00-  401.70] MTD012ME: older people so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station so it would be kind of more telephone shape
[  402.66-  420.00] MTD012ME: and besides that we would advise to bring two additions one with a wood like color and maybe feel and one with a gray black color we would like for the more exclusive people people with more money
[  420.00-  422.28] MTD012ME: the gray black color for well
[  425.32-  427.30] MTD012ME: people with less means
[  430.96-  432.04] MTD012ME: that would be all
[  432.56-  437.58] MTD009PM: ok thank you any questions about the trends
[  436.36-  437.12] MTD012ME: no questions
[  438.38-  439.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[  440.60-  443.64] MTD009PM: no ok we are going to the next
[  464.16-  480.00] MTD011UID: kay yeah did some research about designing of interface yeah last meeting we had about using a few buttons so
[  480.00-  485.34] MTD011UID: yeah that is what i want to
[  486.80-  509.16] MTD011UID: to do in our design so finding an at attractive way to control the remote control i found some something about speech recognition so maybe we can use that
[  509.40-  510.00] MTD011UID: yeah and
[  510.00-  522.62] MTD011UID: using a little display so finance yeah just you have to just to focus on the primary functions
[  522.80-  539.20] MTD011UID: so only buttons for sound for on off shifting o up senator can channel or down shifting down let us see yeah and
[  540.52-  562.48] MTD011UID: yeah f we need some new and attractive functions which attract people for using it so it is like speak speech recognition and special button for selecting subtitles just as we mentioned last meeting
[  563.40-  570.00] MTD011UID: and yeah overall user friendly so using large large buttons
[  570.00-  593.16] MTD011UID: it is possible to to make quite cheap system for speech recognition you can think about when you lost your remote control you can call it and it gives a an signal so yeah
[  593.56-  600.00] MTD011UID: and for shifting up a s a channel or for
[  600.00-  609.38] MTD011UID: putting out the sound or something you can just give a sign say sound off or
[  610.34-  617.84] MTD011UID: a and yeah the television put the sound off put the sound off
[  619.80-  630.00] MTD011UID: let us see yeah i was thinking about a special button for subtitles just one button to keep it simple one push on the button you get
[  630.00-  631.88] MTD011UID: s small subtitles
[  632.52-  642.04] MTD011UID: double push push double click so you get big subtitles for people
[  643.28-  651.36] MTD011UID: which can for who can read small subtitles over
[  653.00-  660.00] MTD011UID: yeah and we we have to keep in general buttons so we got the buttons we have to use the
[  660.00-  666.08] MTD011UID: on off sound on off sound higher lower and the numbers zero to a nine
[  667.22-  685.48] MTD011UID: and the general button m more general one button for shifting up shifting down the general also we want to use a little di display for for displaying the functions of the buttons
[  686.08-  690.00] MTD011UID: and we can build in a function f which
[  690.00-  702.20] MTD011UID: shows the channel or thong which the t television is on so i made a little picture of it
[  703.62-  704.28] MTD011UID: let us see
[  709.76-  720.00] MTD011UID: yeah just we can put on the on off button over here in this corner almost every all
[  720.00-  734.12] MTD011UID: all remote controls are using a b on off button on that place so people will recognize the button so
[  735.38-  746.16] MTD011UID: display of it it is just a small display we can put it on top it is the most
[  747.88-  750.00] MTD011UID: yeah place people
[  750.00-  765.76] MTD011UID: most often looks at so and special button for shifting up and shifting down channel it is on place where the thumb of of the
[  767.20-  774.04] MTD011UID: so you you can easily shift up or shift down it is quite
[  775.60-  780.00] MTD011UID: handy place so and other f functions for a sub time
[  780.00-  783.08] MTD011UID: itle one button for sound
[  784.72-  792.88] MTD011UID: yeah and the overall design yeah we have to discuss about it i think so the form of it so
[  794.24-  794.56] MTD009PM: ok
[  794.72-  795.72] MTD011UID: and that is it
[  796.32-  797.88] MTD009PM: thank you
[  807.72-  808.32] MTD0010ID: ok
[  814.38-  836.00] MTD0010ID: about the components design for the energy source we can use a basic battery or a as an optional thing kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy but if we s choose for that option the docking station become obsolete so i do not think it is really an option
[  836.88-  840.00] MTD0010ID: for the casing the
[  840.00-  853.44] MTD0010ID: fiction department can deliver a flat casing single or double curved casing it is really up to the design that we are going to use it is does not imply any technical restrictions
[  854.24-  861.52] MTD0010ID: as a case supplement we could i thought of that later a a rubber bell like a anti slip
[  863.40-  870.00] MTD0010ID: for the bu buttons we can use plastic or rubber and the chip set it says simple here but
[  870.00-  873.26] MTD0010ID: it should be advanced because we are using an l c d screen
[  874.18-  889.12] MTD0010ID: and as the trend watcher presentation shows people like wood but it raises the price and it does not really fit the image unless we would start two product lines the form should follow function overall
[  889.70-  900.00] MTD0010ID: well a kinetic energy source is rather fancy but depends on what we want i think we should dis discuss that
[  900.00-  915.76] MTD0010ID: for the case the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control and that is it
[  916.20-  917.84] MTD009PM: ok thank you
[  920.08-  924.32] MTD009PM: so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts
[  934.62-  934.94] MTD009PM: yeah
[  945.06-  948.24] MTD009PM: so these are the points we have to discuss
[  949.60-  953.18] MTD009PM: first
[  955.54-  960.00] MTD009PM: i think we can talk about the energy source since that is
[  961.64-  970.12] MTD009PM: has a pretty big influence on production price and image so
[  971.24-  979.28] MTD009PM: f i think first of all we have to see it it is possible to introduce kinetic energy yes richard
[  977.98-  990.00] MTD0010ID: yes there are there are four options we could use the basic normal battery a a hand dynamo but i do not think that is really an option cause you do not want to swing before you can wait
[  982.32-  982.66] MTD009PM: yeah
[  986.24-  987.78] MTD009PM: ok
[  990.00-  997.68] MTD0010ID: the television solar cells but not every room is very light so it is not a very good option or the kinetic energy
[  990.66-  991.04] MTD009PM: yeah
[  994.40-  994.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[  999.40- 1001.06] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[ 1000.76- 1004.08] MTD012ME: and how exactly does the kinetic energy works they just
[ 1003.60- 1007.88] MTD0010ID: well you you basically shake your remote and then it powers up yeah
[ 1005.16- 1007.48] MTD012ME: we use it and it works
[ 1008.48- 1008.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1009.02- 1017.06] MTD012ME: ok well personally i do not think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it
[ 1009.08- 1009.40] MTD011UID: kay
[ 1017.24- 1018.16] MTD0010ID: yeah that is true
[ 1019.24- 1020.00] MTD012ME: and because
[ 1020.00- 1032.68] MTD012ME: besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can
[ 1033.72- 1035.60] MTD012ME: get great popularity for our product
[ 1037.68- 1038.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1038.00- 1038.52] MTD011UID: but
[ 1038.44- 1040.08] MTD012ME: for
[ 1039.72- 1043.74] MTD011UID: what is the function yeah it is for for loading up the batteries but
[ 1044.24- 1050.00] MTD012ME: yeah you could load up the batteries you could insert the find the lost
[ 1045.02- 1045.40] MTD011UID: well but
[ 1050.00- 1051.96] MTD012ME: remote control function in there
[ 1052.80- 1073.28] MTD011UID: ok but it will not use much en energy i b i believe it is just a small display so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or m or more so i believe one battery is just enough so
[ 1068.72- 1069.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1073.96- 1080.00] MTD009PM: yeah well i think elderly people just like to have everything in place
[ 1074.90- 1077.20] MTD012ME: that is true
[ 1080.00- 1091.56] MTD009PM: and i do not think they they like a remote just laying everywhere in their rooms so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
[ 1087.18- 1087.64] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1090.92- 1092.04] MTD011UID: yeah that is true yeah
[ 1092.40- 1110.00] MTD009PM: and also what you said you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote but i think it is more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station so you have
[ 1101.70- 1102.12] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1110.00- 1114.40] MTD009PM: butt button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping
[ 1114.80- 1115.64] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1116.26- 1122.14] MTD009PM: and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the channels
[ 1117.92- 1118.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1122.64- 1123.00] MTD011UID: no
[ 1123.24- 1123.96] MTD009PM: it is
[ 1123.34- 1129.54] MTD012ME: i am wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
[ 1130.24- 1131.98] MTD009PM: yeah that is a good point
[ 1131.38- 1136.32] MTD0010ID: i do not have any m information on pricing so i will have to ask the manufacturing department
[ 1137.34- 1140.00] MTD012ME: cause in our earlier
[ 1140.00- 1145.56] MTD012ME: market research if you would allow me to make the flat board flat board
[ 1142.64- 1144.76] MTD009PM: yeah flat board go ahead
[ 1150.60- 1152.36] MTD012ME: so it was open here
[ 1153.62- 1155.94] MTD012ME: we also
[ 1159.12- 1170.00] MTD012ME: asked if w they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control well you can see here our target group would not do that so if they would increase the
[ 1167.88- 1168.28] MTD009PM: no
[ 1170.00- 1172.28] MTD012ME: price for which we are selling our remote control
[ 1173.92- 1181.76] MTD012ME: i would greatly advise not to do it i think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for the
[ 1176.48- 1176.90] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1183.12- 1183.30] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1183.20- 1183.92] MTD012ME: younger people
[ 1185.32- 1188.12] MTD0010ID: but that would also go for the l c d screen then i guess
[ 1185.60- 1186.20] MTD011UID: kay
[ 1189.46- 1191.36] MTD0010ID: it is a bit higher percentage but
[ 1193.12- 1200.00] MTD012ME: well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it so that does not really
[ 1200.00- 1209.70] MTD012ME: mean they would not pay extra for it and on top of that the l c d screen would help in making the remote control easier to use
[ 1210.70- 1210.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1211.96- 1212.66] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[ 1212.14- 1217.72] MTD012ME: and i think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
[ 1212.30- 1212.68] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 1216.96- 1219.62] MTD009PM: easier to use no i think it is a good point
[ 1220.12- 1230.00] MTD011UID: but it is it is about a big a large l c d s display or just a small one we one
[ 1230.00- 1230.74] MTD011UID: want to use
[ 1230.64- 1237.44] MTD012ME: well this was for like an l c d screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones
[ 1237.72- 1238.20] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1238.48- 1239.72] MTD012ME: so pretty large
[ 1240.02- 1240.26] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1240.36- 1240.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1243.48- 1257.56] MTD009PM: i personally think the l c d screen we want to use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it cause it is just some extra information and it is easy to ignore as well so if you do not want to use it you just do not use it
[ 1250.60- 1250.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1254.68- 1254.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1258.42- 1260.00] MTD009PM: and
[ 1260.00- 1279.44] MTD009PM: yeah i think the maybe we have to discard the voice recognition because it will increase cost significantly and i do not think the i do not think it will be a lot easier to use as well
[ 1280.08- 1280.52] MTD011UID: no
[ 1281.22- 1290.00] MTD009PM: so that brings us back to the energy if we do not have voice recognition it will it will not use a lot of energy to use
[ 1293.48- 1304.66] MTD009PM: so in that case we could use kinetic energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good and much cheaper as well
[ 1304.78- 1305.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1305.86- 1306.32] MTD009PM: so
[ 1305.90- 1307.14] MTD0010ID: and that is the best choice
[ 1307.70- 1314.84] MTD009PM: ok then we just choose for the battery that brings us to the chip
[ 1315.52- 1320.00] MTD0010ID: well there is not any choice there because we are using the the the the display so
[ 1317.50- 1318.48] MTD009PM: just so fast
[ 1320.00- 1321.00] MTD0010ID: it has got to be advanced
[ 1321.26- 1324.64] MTD009PM: ok that is advanced chip
[ 1321.92- 1322.24] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1330.08- 1347.32] MTD009PM: and then we get to the point of the case which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well if you want to choose for wood or the black and gray or both
[ 1349.08- 1349.88] MTD009PM: and then
[ 1350.00- 1372.66] MTD009PM: as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce but i think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids look i have got a new remote control
[ 1355.36- 1355.72] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1371.40- 1380.00] MTD012ME: well i think the most important factor there is the wooden color so it would not actually have to be wood
[ 1371.88- 1373.60] MTD011UID: i do not know
[ 1380.00- 1381.36] MTD012ME: yeah it was just
[ 1380.50- 1380.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1383.52- 1384.00] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 1384.84- 1385.58] MTD012ME: wood colored
[ 1385.06- 1385.48] MTD011UID: and color
[ 1386.16- 1389.04] MTD009PM: but wood color was a lot more expensive or
[ 1389.24- 1393.04] MTD0010ID: i do not know well after research
[ 1389.88- 1390.38] MTD009PM: you do not know
[ 1392.12- 1400.64] MTD009PM: i think so because yeah it is a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape
[ 1394.60- 1395.60] MTD012ME: probably
[ 1400.80- 1410.00] MTD011UID: is it possible to make a changeable case so you got yeah with mobile phones
[ 1410.00- 1418.08] MTD011UID: so like nokia mobile phones when you can change the case of it so
[ 1413.88- 1414.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1417.82- 1419.40] MTD009PM: change the cases yeah
[ 1419.30- 1433.82] MTD011UID: maybe it is possible possibility so you have just to make one standard remote control and yeah you can sell a few yeah
[ 1432.60- 1440.00] MTD009PM: you can sell the case yeah i think that is a very good option cause then you can
[ 1440.00- 1447.68] MTD009PM: advertise as well with give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever
[ 1444.44- 1444.74] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1448.12- 1461.44] MTD009PM: because that is it is something extra so it is something other remotes do not have which we can get a greater advantage point so and then you can make a mood color black and gray other colors as well
[ 1452.68- 1452.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1453.96- 1455.74] MTD012ME: yeah that is true
[ 1460.62- 1461.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1461.80- 1466.70] MTD012ME: yeah we would have to look carefully into the design though
[ 1466.04- 1466.74] MTD009PM: designable
[ 1468.88- 1470.00] MTD012ME: cause we would have to
[ 1470.00- 1475.16] MTD012ME: make one mo control which would fit in with a wooden cover and
[ 1476.46- 1481.52] MTD012ME: plastic cover a more original one with a more standard one
[ 1477.96- 1478.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1482.94- 1487.70] MTD009PM: yeah so you suggest we should design two different telephones
[ 1483.00- 1483.44] MTD012ME: so that would
[ 1488.92- 1498.30] MTD009PM: on which you can apply yeah remote control on which you can apply different case covers for example
[ 1489.00- 1491.64] MTD012ME: well i would not design a telephone but
[ 1496.56- 1500.00] MTD012ME: well no i think we should just we should then just design the
[ 1500.00- 1500.94] MTD012ME: one
[ 1502.18- 1502.60] MTD009PM: remote
[ 1502.36- 1508.68] MTD012ME: one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
[ 1507.80- 1508.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1509.86- 1510.36] MTD009PM: ok
[ 1510.64- 1513.04] MTD012ME: so but that should not be too much of a problem
[ 1514.24- 1517.68] MTD009PM: so everybody is ok with the changing covers
[ 1518.38- 1518.62] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 1518.52- 1520.60] MTD009PM: i think that is a good a good option
[ 1518.56- 1518.94] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1523.88- 1525.56] MTD009PM: changing case covers
[ 1524.94- 1530.00] MTD012ME: i heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double
[ 1530.00- 1533.12] MTD012ME: curved could you explain that a little more
[ 1530.80- 1531.24] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 1531.24- 1531.58] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1533.40- 1547.00] MTD0010ID: well the the general like most older remotes are flat just straight and our de manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases
[ 1547.28- 1549.54] MTD012ME: and what would single curved and double curved mean
[ 1550.08- 1560.00] MTD0010ID: it would just only affect the form for as far as i know so it is ju really just up to the design department what we are going to use
[ 1560.00- 1562.36] MTD0010ID: it does not really matter for the price or the functionality
[ 1560.00- 1560.32] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1562.64- 1565.40] MTD012ME: so we can pretty much just do whatever we want
[ 1564.12- 1565.36] MTD0010ID: pick one you like yes
[ 1566.62- 1567.60] MTD009PM: ok
[ 1566.64- 1566.88] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1567.88- 1568.24] MTD012ME: that is good
[ 1569.32- 1573.08] MTD009PM: but the form has to be it has to
[ 1574.40- 1579.12] MTD009PM: it is has to be possible to stand up or just only to lay down
[ 1578.46- 1579.68] MTD012ME: no just to lay down
[ 1580.20- 1580.72] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1580.50- 1584.16] MTD009PM: and the the cover of the the docking station is also
[ 1581.24- 1582.28] MTD012ME: and cover
[ 1585.24- 1587.92] MTD009PM: on top of the television then why not
[ 1587.88- 1588.88] MTD012ME: well besides it
[ 1590.00- 1600.48] MTD009PM: you can do yeah the click it in that is ok so the interface what type of interface do we want to use
[ 1601.88- 1607.08] MTD009PM: maybe we can make a little drawing of it on the
[ 1607.84- 1608.32] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1609.02- 1613.80] MTD009PM: on the b the board does somebody have ideas for a form or
[ 1615.36- 1619.28] MTD011UID: we can just use the regular form of it but it is
[ 1620.00- 1621.92] MTD011UID: not quite a fancy show no
[ 1623.28- 1623.64] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1624.56- 1649.00] MTD012ME: you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so you could so your thumb would be easily well i think that is a very good point cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r s i so that would be great for that i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
[ 1631.84- 1633.14] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 1650.68- 1653.24] MTD011UID: for for yeah yeah
[ 1650.96- 1653.56] MTD012ME: for left handed users also
[ 1653.44- 1653.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1654.26- 1654.48] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1655.76- 1656.72] MTD011UID: yeah or
[ 1658.28- 1679.28] MTD011UID: is it possible to program it so you got on the left side up on the right side buttons for shifting up and shifting up and on the o or the no the on other side buttons for shifting for for the sound or something
[ 1676.54- 1679.84] MTD012ME: oh
[ 1679.16- 1679.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1681.80- 1687.20] MTD012ME: yeah we could do that but i am not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
[ 1686.80- 1692.40] MTD009PM: ease yeah easy views will be a lot more difficult on the events
[ 1687.84- 1688.50] MTD011UID: easy of use
[ 1693.96- 1705.28] MTD012ME: but if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote
[ 1707.12- 1709.40] MTD012ME: cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff
[ 1710.80- 1711.48] MTD011UID: yeah but
[ 1711.52- 1714.96] MTD009PM: but you have extra buttons so people can get confused
[ 1713.34- 1713.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1714.88- 1715.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1715.52- 1716.18] MTD012ME: that is true
[ 1716.46- 1716.70] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1717.72- 1720.86] MTD009PM: especially if they have the same writings on it
[ 1722.36- 1727.72] MTD011UID: see yeah or you have to make a left on a f t shoulder
[ 1726.40- 1732.34] MTD009PM: can not we make can not we make a remote which you can flip over and use
[ 1733.40- 1734.16] MTD009PM: on the same
[ 1735.72- 1737.88] MTD009PM: functions as the normal one
[ 1738.54- 1739.76] MTD011UID: you mean
[ 1740.28- 1741.60] MTD009PM: then you have to
[ 1740.74- 1741.52] MTD011UID: yeah you
[ 1742.90- 1743.98] MTD009PM: let us see ok
[ 1746.20- 1747.48] MTD009PM: flame
[ 1750.68- 1752.82] MTD009PM: then you go
[ 1772.70- 1774.82] MTD009PM: he has a little l c d screen
[ 1777.72- 1781.08] MTD009PM: you have to think
[ 1804.34- 1805.52] MTD009PM: it is a plus and a min
[ 1808.60- 1814.96] MTD009PM: no it is not very handy i think because the plus and a min will be opposite and ok it is ok
[ 1813.08- 1813.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1813.20- 1813.52] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1816.98- 1818.12] MTD009PM: no it is not handy
[ 1819.82- 1830.00] MTD009PM: i guess maybe it is yeah but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand
[ 1821.32- 1822.32] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1830.00- 1832.62] MTD009PM: i think the functions are
[ 1833.88- 1839.60] MTD009PM: that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel or
[ 1838.00- 1840.02] MTD012ME: yeah that is true
[ 1839.72- 1840.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1841.80- 1846.78] MTD011UID: it is just using your thumb so it is
[ 1844.60- 1849.60] MTD009PM: yeah yeah i think we could just leave it the normal shape
[ 1849.58- 1849.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1850.00- 1850.36] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1851.92- 1853.64] MTD009PM: but maybe we have to
[ 1855.66- 1859.88] MTD009PM: make it a li b a bit more fancy in one another way
[ 1860.06- 1860.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1861.94- 1867.84] MTD0010ID: i think we should start by by choosing a case because that is the basis you are building on
[ 1866.92- 1868.32] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 1868.74- 1869.14] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1869.24- 1869.38] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1871.44- 1873.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1871.76- 1874.44] MTD0010ID: so like a draw the map
[ 1880.24- 1881.52] MTD0010ID: you got the flat case
[ 1882.72- 1883.30] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 1890.00- 1899.92] MTD0010ID: from the side so it is rather normal with a single curved so i am not really sure what they are going to look like but i think it is something like this
[ 1891.38- 1892.04] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1891.82- 1892.10] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1892.56- 1892.92] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1907.36- 1916.32] MTD0010ID: so this type should be better for you or better it should prevent prevent a strain injury a bit
[ 1912.00- 1912.48] MTD009PM: easy
[ 1918.56- 1920.00] MTD0010ID: and a double curved
[ 1920.00- 1922.74] MTD0010ID: s something like this i guess
[ 1933.16- 1936.00] MTD0010ID: so those are the three options we have
[ 1933.16- 1933.40] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1936.24- 1949.84] MTD009PM: kay i suggest the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in so that elderly people can
[ 1950.00- 1957.60] MTD009PM: use a remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen because it is a bit it has a bit of a angle
[ 1955.80- 1956.48] MTD011UID: so
[ 1958.76- 1960.14] MTD011UID: you say this
[ 1963.28- 1963.92] MTD011UID: so
[ 1967.68- 1972.66] MTD011UID: you got like sort of leaf here here
[ 1972.52- 1972.76] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1974.00- 1979.80] MTD011UID: so you want to put this play over here no
[ 1979.08- 1980.00] MTD009PM: yeah i think so
[ 1980.00- 1980.56] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1983.62- 2000.92] MTD011UID: yeah s can make it this top so this top this down maybe it is possible to make this side like let us see that
[ 1984.96- 1985.68] MTD009PM: and now it is
[ 1986.88- 1991.52] MTD009PM: do you have an upside down or do you have an this that is top
[ 1992.48- 1992.90] MTD009PM: kay
[ 2001.96- 2004.28] MTD011UID: color no
[ 2010.76- 2014.24] MTD011UID: to make this side and that
[ 2016.70- 2022.92] MTD011UID: so what i call it a bit like so in the form of your hand so
[ 2024.46- 2025.42] MTD011UID: it is an
[ 2025.82- 2026.22] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2026.96- 2035.36] MTD011UID: so so the remote control have to lay in your hand so it is possible therefore so so and
[ 2034.60- 2036.18] MTD009PM: so you get your nose yeah
[ 2037.14- 2039.96] MTD011UID: and the good and the
[ 2040.00- 2041.52] MTD011UID: the buttons for
[ 2042.86- 2046.00] MTD011UID: changing the channel over here
[ 2046.92- 2053.86] MTD009PM: yeah that is a good one but i think it is better to put the screen on top
[ 2055.64- 2067.60] MTD009PM: so i just flip it hundred and eighty degrees around and you can flip the display that is around here if you can have this one you turn it like this and then flip it upside down
[ 2059.04- 2061.20] MTD011UID: yeah but display
[ 2068.38- 2070.00] MTD011UID: yeah this i do not know
[ 2070.44- 2074.90] MTD009PM: because maybe your hand is in the way of you of the display here
[ 2074.04- 2074.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2074.30- 2074.62] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2076.52- 2081.84] MTD0010ID: it is more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it is always a mobile phone
[ 2078.60- 2079.00] MTD009PM: i think
[ 2079.04- 2080.52] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2081.36- 2081.80] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2081.52- 2081.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2086.20- 2086.44] MTD011UID: so
[ 2086.92- 2087.92] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2088.02- 2090.30] MTD0010ID: and maybe you should just s start on a blank page
[ 2090.56- 2091.20] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2091.80- 2092.68] MTD009PM: so then we get
[ 2106.36- 2108.38] MTD009PM: where is the curve
[ 2117.24- 2118.76] MTD011UID: five minutes yeah
[ 2122.80- 2130.00] MTD009PM: here the display and then buttons and then we can have a little bit off here
[ 2130.00- 2134.20] MTD009PM: here button just that is for left hand remote hand user
[ 2134.14- 2134.88] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2136.08- 2139.58] MTD009PM: and then the rest of the buttons here
[ 2138.92- 2144.64] MTD011UID: yeah but the on off button still on the top yeah
[ 2143.60- 2145.00] MTD009PM: yeah still here
[ 2145.84- 2146.10] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2146.52- 2146.86] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2146.72- 2149.20] MTD012ME: would not prefer the corners to be round
[ 2149.44- 2149.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2149.90- 2151.00] MTD011UID: yeah ok
[ 2151.00- 2151.92] MTD012ME: i think that would be a
[ 2151.20- 2153.44] MTD009PM: it is a bit more a bit more friendly
[ 2154.36- 2155.16] MTD012ME: friendly on the other
[ 2155.72- 2156.24] MTD009PM: kay
[ 2157.60- 2160.00] MTD009PM: supplements it is
[ 2160.00- 2160.32] MTD009PM: kay
[ 2161.88- 2164.76] MTD009PM: that is very nice then
[ 2169.54- 2188.20] MTD009PM: we have got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we are going to use so now for the next meeting we will have to look at the look at field design it is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote so check out the corporate website maybe
[ 2188.92- 2189.92] MTD009PM: the user interface design
[ 2190.00- 2207.72] MTD009PM: it is the same story and product evaluation so the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on this one but you are going to get your instructions i think send them by the coach
[ 2208.52- 2216.44] MTD009PM: so just i will put these minutes on the in the folder
[ 2217.60- 2217.84] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 2218.60- 2220.00] MTD009PM: and then we are going to
[ 2220.00- 2243.60] MTD009PM: try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers which are let us see i am not sure if you are going to start right away to work together or i think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first and then you will get a message
[ 2241.48- 2241.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2242.04- 2242.54] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2243.54- 2243.78] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2244.80- 2250.00] MTD009PM: so let us basically maybe this one
[ 2250.00- 2252.40] MTD009PM: and we can save this one in the
[ 2255.92- 2256.84] MTD009PM: folder screw
[ 2261.72- 2272.34] MTD009PM: oh yeah it is it is here the smart board there it is so if you want to have a look at it it is over there in the project folder
[ 2263.60- 2263.82] MTD012ME: ok
[ 2272.20- 2272.38] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2274.52- 2277.64] MTD009PM: and then i guess we will start in thirty minutes again
[ 2279.26- 2280.00] MTD009PM: thank you
[ 2279.46- 2279.88] MTD012ME: ok
[ 2280.00- 2280.28] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 2280.00- 2280.12] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2280.00- 2280.36] MTD011UID: ok

[   60.00-   80.26] MTD009PM: design and we will do some evaluation about the not only the product but also the project and then we are going to close the project today as well so after that you will be free to go and spend all your money
[   80.96-   90.00] MTD009PM: and this design detailed design meeting we will discuss the look and feel of the design the
[   90.00-  100.52] MTD009PM: usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation in order to do that we have this agenda
[  101.36-  120.00] MTD009PM: we will have the prototype presentation first then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria then we will look at the finance we will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget because everything costs money and
[  120.00-  128.98] MTD009PM: the more functions you want to have the more money it will cost so we will f see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
[  129.42-  144.58] MTD009PM: but we will see that later then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that we have got forty minutes so we will be finished at half past three but first
[  145.80-  150.00] MTD009PM: we will do the the prototype presentation
[  150.00-  155.36] MTD009PM: so some some events for it
[  153.32-  153.96] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  157.92-  171.44] MTD0010ID: well this is what me and richard came up with the default spot for the on off button the mute button just below that then there is the volume and channel selectors
[  172.80-  180.00] MTD0010ID: simple plus minus button we thought of a help button if you hold it and you press another
[  180.00-  184.60] MTD0010ID: button the help goes to the l c d screen
[  185.32-  195.48] MTD0010ID: then there is the zero to one to zero buttons a button for teletext a button for the subtitles and the company logo
[  196.64-  205.08] MTD0010ID: so it is rather a simple prototype and we will have to see from testing how the users think it
[  206.28-  206.74] MTD009PM: ok
[  210.00-  213.36] MTD012ME: is this the moment where we ask or can i ask questions about the functionality
[  210.86-  211.28] MTD011UID: yes
[  213.76-  216.04] MTD0010ID: sure just pop in at any time
[  214.00-  214.56] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[  216.28-  225.26] MTD012ME: when you are in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you go to the next teletext page
[  226.94-  235.16] MTD011UID: it is just the normal as just the normal remote controls so
[  236.26-  240.00] MTD011UID: you push it you came in page one on the other side
[  240.00-  252.52] MTD011UID: hundred you can use the normal one to zero buttons and you but you can also use the button for changing the the channel
[  252.60-  261.56] MTD011UID: s so the shifting button for yeah shif shifting up in on t on te teletext and shifting down so
[  255.36-  255.68] MTD012ME: ok
[  262.32-  265.08] MTD012ME: ok
[  269.20-  270.00] MTD009PM: ok
[  270.00-  289.16] MTD009PM: but i thought in a few meetings earlier we try to give it simple just a few buttons and large buttons but i think these are altogether quite quite a few buttons
[  280.20-  280.82] MTD011UID: yeah
[  291.08-  295.60] MTD009PM: i am wondering if we if we need i really need all of those buttons
[  297.38-  298.56] MTD0010ID: i think if you look at
[  300.00-  313.04] MTD0010ID: most controls they have got more buttons than this well the on off button it is it is a necessity we can not drop that one the volume and channel buttons you need you obviously needs those those
[  302.84-  303.38] MTD009PM: that is right
[  306.60-  306.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[  313.44-  313.92] MTD009PM: yeah
[  314.36-  330.00] MTD0010ID: the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice so we could cancel that one i think the help button really is necessary because there is no other way to know
[  326.64-  327.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[  330.00-  331.98] MTD0010ID: when someone wants to know what a button does
[  334.72-  335.50] MTD009PM: oh yeah
[  334.76-  353.32] MTD011UID: yeah or you can build in when you press one button yeah but yeah we disk discussed it already but we think all people do not know that option so they just put in put press the button and
[  338.72-  341.28] MTD009PM: load up yeah put
[  354.72-  356.22] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[  356.60-  357.96] MTD0010ID: well you can not
[  359.30-  360.00] MTD0010ID: leave out the
[  360.00-  361.08] MTD0010ID: number buttons i guess
[  361.06-  361.36] MTD011UID: no
[  361.36-  366.08] MTD009PM: yeah and teletexting subtitles or yeah that is ok
[  362.64-  363.00] MTD0010ID: and
[  364.34-  367.76] MTD0010ID: yeah so it is rather basic already
[  364.70-  364.98] MTD011UID: no
[  365.08-  365.36] MTD012ME: yeah
[  368.18-  375.80] MTD012ME: yeah i think so that is what i pointed out earlier if you just make a control for just the t v there is just not much to gain here
[  375.66-  375.84] MTD011UID: no
[  376.00-  376.40] MTD009PM: yeah
[  378.02-  383.00] MTD009PM: ok so you had somebody about you want to say something about the design of the buttons there
[  383.38-  390.00] MTD0010ID: yeah they are it is rather hard to draw the whiteboard but they are supposed to be equal sized
[  384.52-  386.60] MTD009PM: just normal plain yeah buttons
[  384.52-  386.16] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[  390.00-  399.22] MTD0010ID: round with with a little logo on it for the m for the volume the the triangle and so just for recognition
[  396.20-  398.52] MTD011UID: yeah just to recognize it so
[  396.54-  398.44] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[  399.40-  402.48] MTD011UID: yeah and we do not need led or
[  402.84-  403.30] MTD009PM: no
[  403.56-  413.48] MTD011UID: s some remote controls do have so but because we use the little display we do not have to use it so
[  407.12-  407.56] MTD009PM: no
[  412.94-  414.48] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[  414.52-  420.00] MTD0010ID: so and for the materials we have just chosen for rubber buttons with a different
[  417.84-  418.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[  418.76-  418.96] MTD009PM: yeah
[  420.00-  423.26] MTD0010ID: different color than the case so they jump out
[  425.16-  443.12] MTD009PM: ok that is fine that is nice then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part which is pretty exciting to see if it is all possible what we want to do and i can tell you
[  425.30-  426.72] MTD0010ID: yeah that is about it
[  445.14-  450.00] MTD009PM: that we are going to have a pretty hard time producing this
[  450.00-  451.84] MTD009PM: for twelve and a half euros
[  454.20-  465.72] MTD009PM: if we see i do not know if i have failed in correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong i counted two batteries but maybe we can also use one i do not know if that is possible
[  465.12-  466.24] MTD012ME: so is it rechargeable
[  466.88-  468.28] MTD009PM: that is rechargeable that is all
[  467.88-  469.72] MTD011UID: yeah we can use it now
[  471.60-  479.64] MTD009PM: ok that is two euros up ok we need the advanced chip so there are not much to
[  474.76-  475.48] MTD011UID: kay
[  478.04-  478.44] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  482.04-  494.16] MTD009PM: to save there here we have the single curved we can see that the difference between uncurved and single curved is one euro
[  495.68-  507.72] MTD009PM: i do not know but i think the single curved is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control i think we have to keep that
[  500.36-  500.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[  505.84-  506.24] MTD0010ID: yes
[  507.60-  507.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[  508.94-  510.00] MTD009PM: then we have the
[  510.00-  522.52] MTD009PM: case material supplements it is plastic it is the cheapest one we need so that is not much to save either but then the biggest costs are the buttons
[  523.08-  539.22] MTD009PM: so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low because we will have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end
[  527.00-  527.68] MTD011UID: ok
[  530.78-  531.00] MTD011UID: kay
[  540.92-  552.82] MTD009PM: so if we let us first first count the buttons we have now cause i sixteen now that will be even more than eighteen euros
[  543.36-  543.72] MTD011UID: yeah
[  545.04-  546.40] MTD011UID: sixteen i would be sure
[  556.26-  556.96] MTD009PM: so
[  556.46-  557.36] MTD011UID: sefteens
[  558.36-  559.04] MTD009PM: so
[  559.58-  560.74] MTD011UID: yeah with the help button
[  562.20-  569.72] MTD009PM: ok including the help yeah i think we can discard the help and the mute button
[  562.30-  562.62] MTD0010ID: ok
[  563.02-  563.42] MTD012ME: ok
[  563.58-  563.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[  570.92-  575.76] MTD009PM: by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number
[  577.12-  577.34] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  577.58-  583.48] MTD009PM: long that saves us one euro already cause then we have got fifteen i think
[  583.28-  583.54] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  584.80-  587.38] MTD012ME: would not
[  585.68-  587.28] MTD009PM: fifteen that is
[  589.12-  589.82] MTD009PM: and this is
[  589.28-  594.36] MTD012ME: i d i assume you would count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each right
[  594.60-  596.38] MTD009PM: no those are one i think
[  595.76-  596.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[  597.68-  600.00] MTD012ME: i do not think actually there are two buttons
[  597.96-  598.80] MTD011UID: wait
[  600.00-  603.28] MTD011UID: yeah it is just one button but
[  600.00-  600.16] MTD012ME: right
[  604.48-  614.96] MTD011UID: yeah there were two for one big button but they are more expensive than the small ones i so
[  614.40-  625.82] MTD009PM: yeah but it is not stated in this case so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
[  616.46-  619.22] MTD011UID: it is just average
[  625.10-  628.92] MTD012ME: well i am thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
[  630.46-  631.88] MTD009PM: that is a possibility as well
[  632.08-  634.02] MTD012ME: that would cut the costs
[  634.96-  638.30] MTD009PM: so and it is good for the design as well so you can make
[  639.82-  643.54] MTD009PM: let us see if you make this
[  661.38-  662.84] MTD009PM: this could like
[  664.32-  666.04] MTD009PM: cross
[  670.56-  672.24] MTD009PM: cross name
[  674.62-  684.94] MTD011UID: but i do not do not know if if it is cheaper so we still got four buttons but just so
[  677.32-  679.94] MTD009PM: s yeah check yeah
[  685.02-  687.56] MTD009PM: yeah i think they count the the materials
[  687.38-  690.00] MTD011UID: we got not not a better better set
[  690.00-  693.78] MTD011UID: but on the on the chip
[  692.80-  694.60] MTD009PM: yeah on the chip yeah
[  693.96-  698.60] MTD011UID: yeah on the chip you got still for for buttons so
[  694.60-  694.92] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  696.40-  697.60] MTD009PM: that is right that is right
[  698.44-  698.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[  698.92-  706.04] MTD009PM: but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button but no but i think
[  701.88-  702.64] MTD011UID: yeah but
[  705.64-  708.48] MTD012ME: but i think this really is for buttons anyhow
[  709.16-  709.68] MTD0010ID: yes
[  711.70-  720.00] MTD009PM: yeah maybe it is but then it seems to me that it is impossible to put itself in half euros
[  720.00-  731.66] MTD009PM: also the l c display i think it is i think it is too expensive for the display we use i think they tried
[  721.44-  722.00] MTD012ME: yes
[  723.86-  725.32] MTD0010ID: and that is that is a big cost
[  731.68-  735.88] MTD0010ID: if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
[  737.90-  745.36] MTD009PM: that is right but what is the big advantage of our remote then
[  745.40-  746.88] MTD012ME: only the docking station i guess
[  747.80-  748.32] MTD009PM: yeah
[  749.86-  750.00] MTD0010ID: we
[  750.00-  754.02] MTD0010ID: is not the the docking station is not even in this sch schematic
[  755.40-  759.92] MTD009PM: no that is extra that is extra that is very
[  755.42-  758.00] MTD0010ID: so it is not even taken into the
[  760.80-  762.48] MTD012ME: maybe we should move to a different supplier
[  764.16-  780.00] MTD009PM: that is an option or something polish do not you think we can if we can count this as bu as one button and integrate th these buttons in three
[  768.28-  768.76] MTD012ME: yeah
[  780.00-  783.36] MTD009PM: and then it would save a lot of money as well
[  782.96-  789.08] MTD0010ID: we we could save money on it but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
[  789.98-  792.12] MTD012ME: yeah that is what i am wondering
[  791.60-  794.32] MTD0010ID: my mother can not even send send an s m s message
[  795.54-  796.08] MTD0010ID: so
[  795.72-  797.28] MTD009PM: yeah that is ok
[  798.12-  798.68] MTD012ME: oh
[  798.52-  804.00] MTD011UID: and we going to buy a a remote control when you can use it so
[  805.86-  806.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[  807.96-  810.00] MTD011UID: we m we must
[  810.00-  819.02] MTD011UID: stay below the below twelve fifty or can not go up in
[  816.60-  816.88] MTD009PM: yeah
[  816.72-  816.90] MTD0010ID: ok
[  819.48-  819.82] MTD009PM: no
[  821.56-  823.40] MTD012ME: well since the market research
[  824.52-  837.16] MTD012ME: indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it is feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little especially since we have those nice features
[  838.22-  840.00] MTD009PM: yeah but we have
[  840.00-  850.38] MTD009PM: to stick to the twelve and a half years we do not have any more budget to do that yeah but it is
[  845.36-  847.40] MTD0010ID: the margin is impossible yeah
[  845.64-  846.56] MTD011UID: is it possible to
[  849.80-  853.08] MTD011UID: is it possible to make one for twelve fifty
[  854.04-  854.86] MTD011UID: i do not think so
[  854.52-  861.88] MTD009PM: it is if you develop the l c d display and if you use less buttons
[  855.28-  857.60] MTD012ME: if you have the r c d display
[  856.50-  856.80] MTD011UID: i do
[  860.44-  860.72] MTD011UID: yeah
[  863.08-  868.24] MTD009PM: say you can use a single chip
[  864.44-  864.72] MTD0010ID: two
[  864.76-  867.64] MTD011UID: but we can not use
[  871.26-  874.44] MTD009PM: there it is
[  872.34-  872.68] MTD011UID: yeah
[  875.48-  876.98] MTD011UID: that we want to make
[  877.72-  878.76] MTD009PM: but then
[  878.28-  883.26] MTD011UID: so fancy and good yeah
[  883.92-  884.66] MTD009PM: could look it
[  884.38-  887.10] MTD011UID: with n
[  889.12-  889.46] MTD009PM: yeah
[  889.32-  896.08] MTD011UID: attractive options so you can stay below twelve fifty so
[  896.24-  898.40] MTD009PM: i think it is difficult as well
[  898.32-  900.00] MTD012ME: basically you would be kind of a choice between
[  900.00-  909.12] MTD012ME: like either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control
[  907.20-  908.60] MTD0010ID: no remote
[  909.76-  916.06] MTD009PM: or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program members
[  917.52-  918.62] MTD011UID: scroll wheel is one
[  917.74-  918.16] MTD009PM: couse
[  918.96-  930.00] MTD009PM: because then we save ten buttons and we have five and one and let us see how we have this one we have got the
[  919.24-  919.78] MTD0010ID: that is not
[  919.64-  920.12] MTD011UID: yeah
[  921.62-  921.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[  930.00-  930.72] MTD009PM: suppose
[  933.80-  936.74] MTD009PM: oh again close
[  934.30-  935.36] MTD0010ID: we are getting closer
[  935.76-  936.66] MTD011UID: yeah
[  938.20-  940.18] MTD012ME: but how the scroll wheel work here
[  943.14-  944.22] MTD009PM: then you will
[  948.16-  949.56] MTD009PM: oh maybe you can
[  952.16-  960.00] MTD009PM: scroll if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l c d display until you have got the right number that
[  958.92-  959.18] MTD0010ID: yeah
[  960.00-  960.60] MTD009PM: you push it
[  961.46-  964.48] MTD012ME: that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also
[  965.64-  972.88] MTD009PM: oh yeah scroll push ok but then you you can push some other buttons and
[  965.74-  969.24] MTD012ME: and create scroll wheel and p push button yeah
[  973.80-  976.08] MTD0010ID: you could just not scroll for a half a second
[  976.68-  982.88] MTD009PM: yeah that is right so if you scroll at a number and then you wait a half second then it will hans to that channel
[  977.48-  979.16] MTD0010ID: so you will not need a button
[  982.58-  985.24] MTD012ME: i think that would be like the end of our usability
[  985.68-  987.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[  987.62-  990.00] MTD009PM: they would definitely
[  990.00-  996.34] MTD009PM: a drop cost a lot we need the battery
[  991.88-  992.40] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1001.14- 1005.40] MTD009PM: and the regular chip is not possible it has to be advanced
[ 1006.80- 1010.40] MTD0010ID: if you want to use an l c d screen you you need an advanced chip yes
[ 1008.78- 1016.74] MTD009PM: yes ok now we can save a euro by a flat design
[ 1020.00- 1025.12] MTD009PM: that is an option we can then we are almost there
[ 1021.28- 1021.50] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1021.72- 1022.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1026.12- 1029.42] MTD0010ID: yeah if you we could just leave out one more button
[ 1030.78- 1032.96] MTD009PM: yeah so if we
[ 1033.24- 1036.44] MTD011UID: yeah or you have to skip the subtitle button
[ 1036.60- 1037.04] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1037.12- 1040.86] MTD009PM: yeah but i think that is that is a big a problem for us
[ 1037.52- 1038.72] MTD011UID: so yeah
[ 1040.40- 1044.42] MTD011UID: yeah it is a big fan sheet but it is
[ 1043.76- 1047.80] MTD009PM: can we use can not we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button
[ 1048.44- 1049.56] MTD0010ID: yeah yeah
[ 1048.54- 1049.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1049.80- 1050.00] MTD012ME: oh
[ 1050.00- 1051.80] MTD009PM: you push it yeah
[ 1050.00- 1060.60] MTD012ME: i think it is pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight eight eight and teletext disappears but the subtitles stay there
[ 1051.40- 1051.86] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1057.14- 1057.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1057.72- 1058.02] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1061.64- 1064.10] MTD011UID: but if you push the teletext button twice
[ 1062.40- 1063.68] MTD012ME: yeah that is the case i am lost
[ 1064.90- 1070.16] MTD0010ID: what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight eight hundred eighty eight
[ 1065.94- 1066.20] MTD011UID: it is
[ 1068.92- 1071.80] MTD011UID: one one but a few buttons
[ 1069.00- 1070.24] MTD009PM: yeah that is not nice
[ 1069.64- 1074.98] MTD012ME: well that could be just like yeah scroll to eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
[ 1075.12- 1076.16] MTD0010ID: oh ok
[ 1076.92- 1080.00] MTD012ME: but then again there would be that is just pretty much not an option
[ 1080.00- 1083.76] MTD012ME: for older people who do not even know what a scroll wheel is
[ 1082.28- 1083.00] MTD0010ID: do not even know what
[ 1084.16- 1084.66] MTD011UID: no
[ 1085.36- 1086.04] MTD012ME: holding out a
[ 1085.72- 1086.24] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1087.80- 1093.48] MTD012ME: a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
[ 1096.36- 1097.60] MTD012ME: with only five buttons on it
[ 1099.76- 1100.54] MTD012ME: and a scroll wheel
[ 1101.86- 1110.00] MTD009PM: i think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the
[ 1110.00- 1114.60] MTD009PM: in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel
[ 1115.84- 1117.38] MTD009PM: if you just make it real simple
[ 1120.92- 1130.96] MTD009PM: because it saves it saves a lot of money and we can keep our l c d screen which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel how to use the other buttons as subtitles
[ 1128.74- 1129.60] MTD012ME: true true
[ 1133.16- 1140.00] MTD009PM: and it is good for the innovative design as well if you want to raise the
[ 1140.00- 1140.54] MTD009PM: is
[ 1142.66- 1144.56] MTD009PM: amazing
[ 1157.62- 1159.08] MTD009PM: and it
[ 1167.04- 1169.70] MTD009PM: looks a bit off maybe
[ 1170.00- 1171.44] MTD012ME: it is a pretty big scroll you know
[ 1182.04- 1182.68] MTD009PM: yes
[ 1191.12- 1200.00] MTD009PM: something like that and yeah we have got the scroll one two three four five buttons
[ 1200.00- 1203.00] MTD009PM: if we there is this one
[ 1215.16- 1216.60] MTD009PM: and these are two buttons then
[ 1227.24- 1230.00] MTD0010ID: you could wake two buttons out of the
[ 1230.00- 1232.92] MTD0010ID: that and just
[ 1234.32- 1238.20] MTD0010ID: if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
[ 1236.16- 1236.36] MTD009PM: ok
[ 1239.88- 1242.92] MTD0010ID: so that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel
[ 1241.90- 1242.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1243.84- 1247.04] MTD009PM: that is really a good good idea i think
[ 1252.00- 1257.42] MTD009PM: and that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious more obvious indeed
[ 1255.40- 1256.14] MTD0010ID: more obvious
[ 1260.00- 1264.40] MTD009PM: so we make one volume one through the channel
[ 1271.82- 1282.46] MTD009PM: let us scroll that is right so we have got one two three yeah we can leave the teletext in if we want
[ 1275.00- 1275.82] MTD0010ID: so if we
[ 1282.78- 1284.24] MTD0010ID: yeah so
[ 1283.60- 1284.84] MTD009PM: that is it is better
[ 1284.98- 1286.20] MTD012ME: so this is five points
[ 1285.76- 1290.00] MTD0010ID: if we leave out all those buttons perhaps we can go with the flat
[ 1290.00- 1293.50] MTD0010ID: flat case and make it smaller overall
[ 1295.20- 1304.92] MTD0010ID: so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right beh under that then the scroll button
[ 1295.28- 1295.80] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1301.84- 1302.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1305.24- 1306.88] MTD009PM: yeah ok
[ 1306.24- 1308.00] MTD0010ID: you get a a much smaller remote
[ 1308.12- 1308.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1308.48- 1309.04] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 1310.28- 1310.56] MTD0010ID: and it
[ 1311.40- 1312.00] MTD009PM: so we can
[ 1311.62- 1311.90] MTD0010ID: is
[ 1313.32- 1316.00] MTD009PM: decrease this mode to all buttons
[ 1317.08- 1317.40] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1317.64- 1318.84] MTD012ME: right now we have five
[ 1318.40- 1320.00] MTD011UID: but we can make
[ 1320.00- 1333.74] MTD011UID: f quite big remote control for just the same price as a small one just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved it is a bit
[ 1327.12- 1328.66] MTD009PM: yeah that is the point
[ 1332.22- 1332.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1334.10- 1349.32] MTD009PM: yeah it is it is more the models in which they are being made i think single curved is pretty easy you just fill in and the cases come right out of the machine and single curved you have to have to take right off the machine and the flat one
[ 1339.24- 1339.68] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1350.88- 1354.24] MTD009PM: i think this is a really easy one
[ 1355.72- 1363.68] MTD009PM: what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design fey what do you think
[ 1364.74- 1370.04] MTD012ME: well i still think we should go for the single curved design but then again i mean
[ 1368.00- 1368.40] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1370.00- 1372.24] MTD0010ID: richard argument was very very
[ 1370.86- 1376.00] MTD012ME: all these changes are not really w ok with me but since
[ 1370.98- 1371.24] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1371.48- 1371.72] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1373.90- 1374.24] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1377.08- 1380.00] MTD009PM: we have to cut cost yeah
[ 1377.68- 1378.64] MTD012ME: we just have to
[ 1378.52- 1378.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1380.00- 1381.34] MTD009PM: yeah i am
[ 1380.96- 1382.56] MTD012ME: i would rather just go to the board and
[ 1384.48- 1385.44] MTD009PM: ask for a word
[ 1384.90- 1387.82] MTD012ME: get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote
[ 1386.92- 1387.36] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1388.52- 1390.76] MTD009PM: yeah i am agreeing that it works good at
[ 1389.28- 1392.28] MTD012ME: or do some work research and see what the options are
[ 1393.80- 1410.00] MTD009PM: yeah but i think we can then keep the single curved one just to express our l c d screen a bit more some people will use it more and especially for the help functions it will be good if we had a scroll bar
[ 1403.40- 1403.68] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1403.40- 1403.72] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1410.00- 1415.84] MTD009PM: scroll button will be necessary to get a good help function as well
[ 1423.86- 1425.52] MTD009PM: so scroll
[ 1436.28- 1440.00] MTD009PM: i think it was better to have this price at least a bit earlier
[ 1440.00- 1444.12] MTD009PM: before we went on today so it is a good old design
[ 1440.44- 1442.04] MTD012ME: yes definitely
[ 1441.66- 1442.16] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1445.56- 1445.84] MTD009PM: but
[ 1446.94- 1448.52] MTD009PM: i think that we could make a bit
[ 1450.52- 1450.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1451.38- 1454.88] MTD009PM: that is pretty different all the last one this one
[ 1452.80- 1461.52] MTD012ME: it is pretty different this is not really like for the group you were making a remote this will really require a lot of marketing
[ 1458.80- 1459.04] MTD011UID: no
[ 1462.52- 1463.58] MTD009PM: yeah it will
[ 1463.22- 1464.82] MTD012ME: to get this to sell
[ 1465.64- 1465.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1468.00- 1470.00] MTD012ME: cause if older people like
[ 1468.06- 1468.64] MTD011UID: but
[ 1470.00- 1474.26] MTD012ME: familiar forms and familiar stuff this is not familiar for the
[ 1475.66- 1476.76] MTD009PM: no but i think i
[ 1476.16- 1478.30] MTD012ME: so we are going to have to do a lot of convincing them
[ 1478.24- 1479.06] MTD009PM: i think the most
[ 1479.24- 1488.44] MTD011UID: but they know the scroll buttons from old radios they call also buttons like that for changing channels so maybe it is
[ 1485.52- 1485.96] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1485.54- 1498.82] MTD009PM: yeah we can then we can stick it out with it like a old old button maybe that is recognizable for them as well yeah that is a good one
[ 1491.44- 1492.56] MTD011UID: yeah yeah
[ 1496.68- 1496.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1499.52- 1500.00] MTD009PM: so
[ 1500.00- 1514.60] MTD009PM: i am afraid we have to move on and it is it is f less frightening i think if they see this design and think oh there are only five buttons but we will see
[ 1513.68- 1514.04] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1513.88- 1515.80] MTD012ME: that is true might it might be confusing too
[ 1516.16- 1518.04] MTD009PM: yeah that is the right thing
[ 1517.20- 1519.06] MTD012ME: to be like what only five buttons
[ 1517.24- 1517.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1520.24- 1520.64] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1521.56- 1523.28] MTD011UID: that is very special so
[ 1524.96- 1527.52] MTD009PM: i would buy it
[ 1527.12- 1529.44] MTD012ME: yeah but you are not sixty
[ 1528.28- 1530.00] MTD009PM: that is right i would buy
[ 1530.00- 1536.36] MTD009PM: the evaluacies no i do not know are they cost under twelve and half euros no
[ 1537.54- 1539.40] MTD009PM: yes they are
[ 1539.98- 1541.64] MTD011UID: no
[ 1540.66- 1545.90] MTD009PM: no but we can go on with the project evaluation
[ 1549.64- 1555.20] MTD009PM: let us see we can sit down we still have fifty minutes left so nice and scheduled
[ 1555.76- 1556.32] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1557.34- 1560.00] MTD009PM: the project process
[ 1560.26- 1563.94] MTD012ME: so i like set up all these criteria
[ 1564.62- 1566.42] MTD012ME: and evaluation of the
[ 1564.72- 1569.72] MTD009PM: evaluation criteria that is right that was the point i forgot
[ 1568.04- 1568.46] MTD012ME: thingy
[ 1570.72- 1571.28] MTD009PM: if you should
[ 1573.08- 1585.86] MTD009PM: there we are evaluation criteria we have got five minutes i think for this criteria no we have got fifteen minutes but
[ 1575.64- 1577.36] MTD012ME: thank you go ahead
[ 1582.26- 1583.40] MTD012ME: five minutes
[ 1585.68- 1586.16] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1596.54- 1597.42] MTD009PM: yes
[ 1603.10- 1608.64] MTD012ME: kay so i did some literature study study analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
[ 1609.00- 1609.40] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1609.70- 1620.00] MTD012ME: translated it into criteria which would be these is the remote fancy is shape look and feel innovative what new functions are
[ 1620.00- 1622.32] MTD012ME: there easy to use
[ 1623.60- 1638.24] MTD012ME: learnability is a very important factor here is it functional are there not too many functions and amount of functions and are the those functions and are they are they useful and the costs
[ 1640.80- 1650.00] MTD012ME: the target group is the remote really for the group we are making it for and record mobility
[ 1650.00- 1655.36] MTD012ME: if our company is if it is easily recognizable that our company made it
[ 1659.04- 1660.80] MTD012ME: so we are supposed to evaluate it right now
[ 1661.82- 1662.16] MTD009PM: ok
[ 1664.24- 1664.72] MTD012ME: let us see
[ 1667.40- 1672.60] MTD012ME: oh i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
[ 1673.72- 1674.24] MTD012ME: were not here
[ 1674.20- 1680.00] MTD009PM: yeah that is because my pen failed to upload this data i tried to
[ 1678.00- 1678.44] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1678.12- 1678.88] MTD011UID: ok
[ 1679.48- 1680.00] MTD012ME: it is
[ 1680.00- 1684.08] MTD009PM: but it is it is giving errors by downloading the software
[ 1683.32- 1684.92] MTD012ME: so
[ 1684.08- 1686.98] MTD011UID: kay
[ 1687.14- 1690.00] MTD012ME: is the design fancy on a scale of one to seven
[ 1690.36- 1691.52] MTD009PM: i think it is fancy
[ 1692.56- 1693.14] MTD0010ID: six
[ 1693.44- 1693.58] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1694.28- 1695.36] MTD011UID: six yeah
[ 1694.52- 1696.60] MTD012ME: here we go for six ok
[ 1695.26- 1695.64] MTD009PM: six
[ 1701.04- 1703.92] MTD012ME: is the design innovative
[ 1704.36- 1710.00] MTD009PM: very yeah sabotagation buttons yeah very
[ 1704.42- 1706.10] MTD011UID: yeah sure
[ 1705.10- 1709.28] MTD012ME: i think so with our l c d screen dial station scroll buttons
[ 1709.82- 1710.00] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1710.00- 1717.64] MTD009PM: seven yeah so we have got twenty cents for our docking station
[ 1711.02- 1711.40] MTD012ME: seven
[ 1711.66- 1711.88] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1718.72- 1721.80] MTD012ME: should be the one is the design easy to use
[ 1719.50- 1720.54] MTD009PM: yeah that is right
[ 1722.40- 1723.54] MTD011UID: not really
[ 1723.08- 1725.76] MTD009PM: that is a bit dogy
[ 1725.62- 1726.16] MTD012ME: well
[ 1727.80- 1729.02] MTD012ME: would be for us but
[ 1729.72- 1730.96] MTD011UID: for all people i think
[ 1730.36- 1735.28] MTD009PM: i would say four four or five between between four four five
[ 1732.12- 1733.20] MTD0010ID: four or five
[ 1732.14- 1734.40] MTD011UID: four or five yeah four
[ 1735.78- 1736.66] MTD012ME: i go for four two
[ 1736.64- 1736.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1736.92- 1737.12] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1741.38- 1742.36] MTD009PM: is it functional
[ 1742.72- 1747.14] MTD012ME: is the design functional do we have all functions that we wanted to include
[ 1747.80- 1748.48] MTD009PM: yes
[ 1748.12- 1748.66] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1748.48- 1753.20] MTD012ME: i think we do do we have too many functions no i do not think so it is pretty safe
[ 1750.88- 1751.32] MTD0010ID: no
[ 1751.28- 1751.76] MTD009PM: no
[ 1751.36- 1751.58] MTD011UID: no
[ 1752.88- 1754.10] MTD009PM: i think it is seven
[ 1755.64- 1756.00] MTD012ME: seven
[ 1758.44- 1759.90] MTD012ME: oh and do we
[ 1762.00- 1768.30] MTD012ME: take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control like it getting lost and
[ 1770.00- 1771.48] MTD0010ID: i have never thought of that one
[ 1770.00- 1770.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1770.00- 1773.50] MTD012ME: so that increases what we do
[ 1772.36- 1775.14] MTD009PM: it was i had them worked out
[ 1777.76- 1782.76] MTD009PM: they are ugly not very functional and getting lost
[ 1785.12- 1788.48] MTD012ME: are the production costs written decrease at limits well there i go
[ 1785.30- 1785.66] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1789.64- 1789.84] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1795.00- 1796.98] MTD012ME: does the design fit the group of focus
[ 1798.52- 1800.00] MTD0010ID: i think that is a three
[ 1798.80- 1800.00] MTD011UID: that is a three
[ 1800.00- 1800.54] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1800.32- 1802.30] MTD012ME: yeah that is it
[ 1800.96- 1804.96] MTD009PM: no i think with our new radio button i think it is
[ 1802.72- 1803.04] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1805.60- 1806.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1806.00- 1806.80] MTD009PM: i think it is better
[ 1807.48- 1809.56] MTD011UID: we have to test it some but
[ 1808.16- 1808.78] MTD012ME: oh no
[ 1809.72- 1815.84] MTD0010ID: i still i think it is too too fancy too too flashy
[ 1810.92- 1811.26] MTD012ME: i think
[ 1811.68- 1812.02] MTD009PM: i think it
[ 1815.18- 1820.34] MTD012ME: i think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control
[ 1820.36- 1821.52] MTD011UID: yeah true
[ 1821.72- 1822.04] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1823.92- 1824.96] MTD009PM: i would give it a four
[ 1829.88- 1830.00] MTD012ME: oh
[ 1830.00- 1831.72] MTD012ME: not sure i think i will go for a t
[ 1832.16- 1833.80] MTD011UID: i go for three so
[ 1833.64- 1836.40] MTD009PM: then we have to do the three instead
[ 1835.64- 1835.96] MTD012ME: kay
[ 1843.52- 1847.38] MTD012ME: is cogby cogby recognizable is it the logo there
[ 1845.84- 1847.72] MTD009PM: yes yeah yeah
[ 1846.00- 1846.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1848.82- 1849.16] MTD012ME: so
[ 1852.46- 1860.00] MTD009PM: and they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company we have the remove
[ 1860.00- 1865.42] MTD009PM: able front cases so i think it is very recognizable yeah
[ 1862.16- 1862.36] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1862.62- 1862.92] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1870.38- 1871.40] MTD012ME: so i do not do this
[ 1875.48- 1877.62] MTD012ME: i was also supposed to calculate the score but
[ 1879.04- 1883.52] MTD012ME: thought we would have another private thingy after this
[ 1881.92- 1883.02] MTD009PM: we have got to calculate
[ 1885.30- 1888.06] MTD0010ID: do not to see if we
[ 1886.10- 1888.08] MTD012ME: is this like after this are we done or
[ 1889.12- 1890.00] MTD009PM: we have going to we
[ 1889.62- 1890.00] MTD012ME: that we
[ 1890.00- 1891.60] MTD009PM: go and evaluate
[ 1890.00- 1891.00] MTD012ME: to where i mean
[ 1892.54- 1895.68] MTD012ME: well anyhow these are several factors times seven is forty
[ 1897.08- 1898.08] MTD012ME: something two
[ 1899.26- 1900.04] MTD012ME: nine
[ 1900.90- 1901.60] MTD009PM: forty nine
[ 1902.44- 1903.56] MTD012ME: and minus one
[ 1907.00- 1909.64] MTD012ME: minus three is thirty three
[ 1910.88- 1911.56] MTD012ME: minus four
[ 1913.32- 1915.00] MTD012ME: so maybe minus eight
[ 1916.36- 1918.34] MTD012ME: forty one out of forty nine
[ 1916.94- 1917.50] MTD009PM: forty one
[ 1919.68- 1920.00] MTD009PM: dip
[ 1920.00- 1920.38] MTD009PM: saint
[ 1925.88- 1927.68] MTD009PM: and eighty percent
[ 1926.12- 1926.66] MTD012ME: ok
[ 1928.56- 1931.34] MTD012ME: guess i will just type the f
[ 1934.62- 1937.34] MTD009PM: that is eighty four percent
[ 1943.00- 1945.32] MTD009PM: i think that is a pretty nice score
[ 1943.00- 1943.60] MTD011UID: i think that is
[ 1945.66- 1945.94] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 1945.96- 1946.20] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1957.44- 1961.72] MTD012ME: ok so that would be the application
[ 1961.98- 1963.08] MTD009PM: ok thank you
[ 1966.32- 1966.90] MTD009PM: so
[ 1968.32- 1970.90] MTD009PM: that brings us to the project evaluation
[ 1975.04- 1975.24] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 1976.28- 1980.00] MTD009PM: thank you project process did we
[ 1980.00- 1983.84] MTD009PM: we move through the right phases you think long process
[ 1984.74- 1985.28] MTD0010ID: yes
[ 1985.74- 1987.00] MTD011UID: yeah but
[ 1986.76- 1991.44] MTD012ME: think we should have we should have had the finance thinking a lot earlier
[ 1991.40- 1991.60] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 1992.16- 1992.60] MTD009PM: that is right
[ 1993.40- 1994.42] MTD012ME: in the design phase
[ 1995.22- 1997.92] MTD009PM: so lack of information about prices
[ 1998.36- 1998.58] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 1998.52- 2000.38] MTD0010ID: yeah that is true
[ 1998.60- 1998.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2000.08- 2000.66] MTD012ME: definitely
[ 2000.84- 2001.28] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2003.80- 2004.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2010.44- 2014.62] MTD009PM: ok satisfaction was there room for creativity
[ 2014.88- 2015.08] MTD012ME: no
[ 2016.96- 2021.84] MTD009PM: no not too much no it is because of the finance she
[ 2017.64- 2019.02] MTD012ME: not too much no
[ 2021.44- 2021.80] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2021.82- 2024.18] MTD0010ID: yeah there was an overall but the finance and
[ 2022.78- 2023.52] MTD012ME: yeah true but
[ 2023.94- 2025.20] MTD009PM: yeah the room of yeah
[ 2024.36- 2024.72] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2029.86- 2031.56] MTD012ME: and i would have liked to go for the
[ 2032.74- 2034.20] MTD012ME: younger users also
[ 2036.38- 2038.32] MTD012ME: and just to be able to access the internet and
[ 2040.00- 2040.98] MTD012ME: get something of your own
[ 2044.16- 2045.30] MTD009PM: restrictions
[ 2049.84- 2050.94] MTD009PM: internet access
[ 2053.32- 2062.92] MTD009PM: kay leadership was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions
[ 2064.34- 2064.84] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 2064.36- 2064.62] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2064.36- 2064.58] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2066.54- 2070.00] MTD009PM: teamwork did it workout working together also
[ 2066.84- 2067.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2070.00- 2072.80] MTD009PM: you to view at the last stage
[ 2071.48- 2072.16] MTD0010ID: yeah it was ok
[ 2072.22- 2072.54] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2074.64- 2075.26] MTD009PM: nice
[ 2081.14- 2086.88] MTD0010ID: the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it is very easy
[ 2089.82- 2090.34] MTD009PM: tasks
[ 2091.80- 2092.16] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2093.64- 2098.54] MTD009PM: were they mean sufficient for the tasks that we had to do or were they too much
[ 2099.50- 2100.00] MTD0010ID: well
[ 2100.00- 2103.96] MTD0010ID: the smart board the the the drawing is just a pain in the ass but
[ 2105.36- 2106.16] MTD009PM: smart board
[ 2105.52- 2107.74] MTD0010ID: the digital the digital pen is very nice
[ 2107.64- 2107.84] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2108.72- 2112.28] MTD009PM: if it wants to download it is yeah data
[ 2109.12- 2111.20] MTD012ME: yeah yeah
[ 2109.30- 2109.52] MTD011UID: right
[ 2110.56- 2111.24] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 2111.20- 2111.70] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2117.92- 2119.24] MTD009PM: i have you on the
[ 2123.84- 2127.20] MTD009PM: smart board was irritating
[ 2132.86- 2138.62] MTD009PM: so you rather wanted to have a flip over or something else
[ 2138.10- 2141.10] MTD0010ID: a flip over or a more precise
[ 2138.40- 2140.18] MTD011UID: and have a president you sure so
[ 2141.52- 2141.78] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2142.04- 2142.32] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2142.34- 2144.54] MTD009PM: faster as well i think yeah
[ 2142.60- 2143.60] MTD0010ID: determination yes
[ 2149.52- 2150.06] MTD009PM: flip over
[ 2150.08- 2160.00] MTD011UID: but if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation
[ 2160.00- 2173.40] MTD011UID: it is easier to share it with other people so you can s save it and put it on the internet or in shared f folder or shared directory so
[ 2164.00- 2164.34] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2172.64- 2175.72] MTD012ME: yeah i tried to open the file on my laptop but
[ 2174.52- 2176.44] MTD011UID: so
[ 2175.74- 2176.90] MTD0010ID: no it did not work
[ 2176.92- 2177.62] MTD012ME: not possible
[ 2177.28- 2181.18] MTD009PM: yeah you need the smart board application i think
[ 2179.80- 2180.12] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2182.20- 2185.72] MTD011UID: can can you export it like yeah
[ 2182.60- 2187.60] MTD009PM: but i think you can yeah should be possible yeah you can export it as image
[ 2185.24- 2185.78] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2188.64- 2190.00] MTD009PM: mest yeah most the
[ 2190.00- 2190.20] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2190.00- 2190.96] MTD012ME: we should have done that yeah
[ 2193.72- 2196.74] MTD009PM: so the sharing of information was was ok
[ 2198.12- 2198.64] MTD012ME: penetering
[ 2198.64- 2199.16] MTD0010ID: yeah
[ 2198.64- 2201.40] MTD009PM: yeah it should work yeah pen is here on the table
[ 2198.92- 2199.32] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2206.88- 2208.96] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2211.44- 2213.44] MTD011UID: see yeah
[ 2212.56- 2216.16] MTD009PM: yeah the ap ap ap it is possible
[ 2215.46- 2216.52] MTD012ME: yeah yeah
[ 2215.56- 2216.20] MTD011UID: it is possible
[ 2217.62- 2217.96] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2218.92- 2219.26] MTD011UID: ok
[ 2220.26- 2223.84] MTD009PM: it is nice have we found new ideas for
[ 2225.52- 2227.52] MTD009PM: having this kind of meeting so
[ 2228.30- 2238.88] MTD011UID: yeah maybe when we n just give the numbers of of
[ 2240.16- 2250.00] MTD011UID: a w one of a out of s seven s it is easier to to do s things like that on the computer
[ 2243.30- 2243.76] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2250.00- 2255.60] MTD011UID: or so just li like the university
[ 2250.88- 2251.16] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2253.00- 2253.28] MTD009PM: so
[ 2256.08- 2267.60] MTD009PM: yeah so everybody puts his own score and then it mediates the score and you can get one yeah that is better so it is
[ 2256.74- 2256.96] MTD011UID: so
[ 2257.04- 2257.44] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2258.54- 2258.98] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2259.28- 2259.88] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2261.72- 2262.08] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2263.40- 2263.78] MTD0010ID: ok
[ 2269.02- 2269.80] MTD009PM: how do we go
[ 2281.36- 2281.96] MTD009PM: faction
[ 2284.64- 2285.48] MTD009PM: materia
[ 2294.80- 2295.40] MTD009PM: ok
[ 2296.66- 2301.88] MTD009PM: any more ideas or questions about the project or about the product
[ 2308.36- 2310.00] MTD009PM: because i think
[ 2310.00- 2310.28] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2315.00- 2318.42] MTD009PM: and let we get to our last shoot
[ 2320.98- 2322.24] MTD009PM: articles within the budget
[ 2323.40- 2323.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2324.36- 2324.68] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2324.90- 2325.32] MTD012ME: they are
[ 2326.34- 2330.24] MTD0010ID: considering we are not going to make a docking station
[ 2326.48- 2327.40] MTD009PM: yeah we
[ 2330.04- 2339.42] MTD009PM: docking station that is a point but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
[ 2340.68- 2341.04] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2341.46- 2344.60] MTD009PM: and i think you can compensate that as well
[ 2341.56- 2342.00] MTD0010ID: right
[ 2345.86- 2350.52] MTD009PM: so i think that should not be the biggest problem because it is very cheap to make as well
[ 2351.62- 2351.98] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2352.06- 2369.96] MTD009PM: but we think we are going to get the twelve and a half million how was it fifteen fifteen million i think we will if we are going to export this product it is innovative especially in america people are going to take it there
[ 2356.56- 2357.68] MTD012ME: fifty cro
[ 2364.32- 2364.58] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2369.56- 2370.00] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2371.18- 2371.84] MTD009PM: sometimes
[ 2372.64- 2376.26] MTD012ME: yeah i still do not think i mean if we are going to make a scroll button anyway
[ 2373.12- 2373.44] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2378.12- 2379.24] MTD009PM: you can do it
[ 2378.12- 2384.04] MTD012ME: it would be more for the younger people than for the older people so maybe we should just refocus
[ 2381.84- 2382.16] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2381.92- 2382.18] MTD011UID: ok
[ 2385.16- 2400.00] MTD009PM: just put it on the market for everybody you can you can change markets where by changing the front cover that is one thing you can change it to so you can also try to
[ 2387.96- 2390.04] MTD012ME: or specifically for younger people
[ 2394.10- 2394.28] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2395.02- 2395.64] MTD012ME: that is true
[ 2400.00- 2409.60] MTD009PM: reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on on the market just as a test see how it works that is i think a good advantage
[ 2409.20- 2417.58] MTD012ME: yeah i think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is than would be with
[ 2419.22- 2419.96] MTD012ME: older people
[ 2420.40- 2420.74] MTD009PM: yeah
[ 2421.64- 2423.24] MTD012ME: even if it were their covers
[ 2423.72- 2423.92] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2423.84- 2428.88] MTD009PM: yeah then i thought we could have our little celebration but no
[ 2425.58- 2426.48] MTD012ME: and then
[ 2430.08- 2439.08] MTD009PM: that is it i think we still have to cut in one more questionnaire i think i do not know i did not get a message
[ 2430.38- 2431.22] MTD012ME: party party
[ 2434.10- 2434.96] MTD011UID: ok so champagne
[ 2435.30- 2435.56] MTD012ME: kay
[ 2440.32- 2448.56] MTD009PM: from the from ending of the five more minutes oh that is nice
[ 2443.96- 2444.88] MTD011UID: blik
[ 2444.78- 2445.22] MTD012ME: oh you do
[ 2448.16- 2448.52] MTD011UID: ok
[ 2451.40- 2460.00] MTD009PM: then we still have some questions if somebody has some questions they can ask them now they can put these in
[ 2460.00- 2462.46] MTD009PM: project folder as well
[ 2462.54- 2462.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2478.32- 2481.36] MTD009PM: export files picture i think
[ 2482.16- 2482.64] MTD012ME: yeah
[ 2482.48- 2482.76] MTD011UID: yeah
[ 2496.68- 2499.96] MTD009PM: this is another i guess
